Emoji Overload: Every message must contain a minimum of five emojis. Bonus points for using the rarest emojis you can find.      Mandatory Fun Facts: Each user must share a fun fact about narwhals or space hamsters before joining any conversation.      Pirate Speak Wednesdays: Every Wednesday, all users must communicate exclusively in pirate lingo. Arrr!      Random Compliment Hour: Once a day, at a randomly selected hour, everyone must give a compliment to another user, but only about their typing speed or choice of font.      Mystery Topic Mondays: Every Monday, a mystery topic (like the history of invisible ink or the aerodynamics of flying carpets) is chosen and all discussions must revolve around it.      Silly Hats Required: All users must describe the silly hat they're 'wearing' when chatting. The more outrageous, the better!      Time Travel Tuesdays: Discussions must be about events that happened either 100 years ago or 100 years in the future.      No Repeating Letters: On Thursdays, no word in any message can have repeating letters. Itâ€™s tricky, but totlly doable!
