Originally home to many native tribes, present-day Alabama was a Spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the French acquired it in the early eighteenth century. The British won the territory in 1763 until losing it in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Spain held Mobile as part of [[Spanish West Florida]] until 1813. In December 1819, Alabama was recognized as a state. During the antebellum period, Alabama was a major [[Cotton production in the United States|producer of cotton]], and widely used [[African Americans|African American]] [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor. In 1861, the state seceded from the United States to become part of the [[Confederate States of America]], with Montgomery acting as its first capital, and rejoined the Union in 1868. Following the [[American Civil War]], Alabama would suffer decades of economic hardship, in part due to [[agriculture]] and a few [[cash crops]] being the main driver of the state's economy. Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] from the late 19th century up until the 1960s.  High-profile events such as the [[Selma to Montgomery march]] made the state a major focal point of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1950s and 1960s.

During and after [[World War II]], Alabama grew as the state's [[Economic diversity|economy diversified]] with new industries. [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in Huntsville would help Alabama's economic growth in the mid-to-late 20th century, by developing an [[aerospace]] industry. Alabama's economy in the 21st century is based on automotive, finance, tourism, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;alaindustrial&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008–2018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |access-date=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state's geography is diverse, with the north dominated by the mountainous [[Tennessee Valley]] and the south by [[Mobile Bay]], a historically significant port. Politically, as part of the [[Deep South]], Alabama is predominantly a [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] state, and is known for its [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern culture]]. Within Alabama, [[American football]], particularly at the [[college football|college]] level, plays a major part of the state's culture.

{{Greek myth}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Achilles''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|ɪ|l|iː|z}} {{respell|ə|KIL|eez}}) or '''Achilleus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Ἀχιλλεύς|Ἀχιλλεύς]]}}) was a hero of the [[Trojan War]], the greatest of all the Greek warriors, and the central character of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]''. He was the son of the [[Nereids|Nereid]] [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], king of [[Phthia]].

Achilles' most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince [[Hector]] outside the gates of [[Troy]]. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the ''Iliad'', other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], who shot him with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with [[Statius]]' unfinished epic ''[[Achilleid]]'', written in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel, because when his mother Thetis dipped him in the river [[Styx]] as an infant, she held him by one of his heels. Alluding to these legends, the term &quot;[[Achilles' heel]]&quot; has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution. The [[Achilles tendon]] is also named after him due to these legends.

'''Abraham Lincoln''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɪ|ŋ|k|ən}} {{Respell|LINK|ən}}; February 12, 1809&amp;nbsp;– April 15, 1865) was an American lawyer, politician, and statesman who served as the 16th [[president of the United States]] from 1861 until [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|his assassination]] in 1865. Lincoln led the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] through the [[American Civil War]] to defend the nation as a constitutional union and succeeded in defeating the insurgent [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolishing]] [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]], bolstering the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], and modernizing the [[U.S. economy]].

Lincoln was born into poverty in a [[log cabin]] in [[Kentucky]] and was raised on the [[American frontier|frontier]], primarily in [[Indiana]]. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and [[U.S. congressman]] [[List of United States representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. In 1854, he was angered by the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], which opened the territories to slavery, causing him to re-enter politics. He soon became a leader of the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|1858 Senate campaign debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas|Stephen A. Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for president [[1860 United States presidential election|in 1860]], sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the [[Southern United States|South]] viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began [[Secession in the United States|seceding from the nation]]. During this time, the newly formed [[Confederate States of America]] began seizing federal military bases in the South. A little over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, Confederate forces [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attacked Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in South Carolina. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union.

Lincoln, a [[Moderate Republicans (Reconstruction era)|moderate Republican]], had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and Republican parties. His allies, the [[War Democrat]]s and the [[Radical Republicans]], demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. Anti-war Democrats (called &quot;[[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]&quot;) despised Lincoln, and some irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements went so far as to plot his assassination. His [[Gettysburg Address]] came to be seen as one of the greatest and most influential statements of American national purpose. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in [[Ex parte Merryman|Maryland]] and [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)|elsewhere]], and averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. In 1863, he issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which declared the slaves in the states &quot;in rebellion&quot; to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to &quot;recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons&quot;, and to receive them &quot;into the armed service of the United States.&quot; Lincoln pressured [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which abolished slavery, except as punishment for a crime.

Lincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just five days after [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|the war's end at Appomattox]], he was attending a play at [[Ford's Theatre]] in Washington, D.C., with his wife, [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]], when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln is remembered as a [[martyr]] and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. Lincoln is often [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States#Scholar survey summary|ranked]] in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history.

'''Aristotle''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ær|ᵻ|s|t|ɒ|t|əl}};{{sfn|Collins English Dictionary}} {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀριστοτέλης}} ''Aristotélēs'', {{IPA-grc|aristotélɛːs|pron}}; 384–322&amp;nbsp;BC) was an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] and [[polymath]]. His writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the [[natural science]]s, [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]], [[economics]], [[politics]], [[psychology]] and [[the arts]]. As the founder of the [[Peripatetic school]] of philosophy in the [[Lyceum (classical)|Lyceum]] in [[Athens]], he began the wider [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern [[science]].

Little is known about Aristotle's life. He was born in the city of [[Stagira (ancient city)|Stagira]] in [[northern Greece]] during the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]]. His father, [[Nicomachus (father of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]], died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At 17 or 18 he joined [[Plato]]'s [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in Athens and remained there till the age of 37 ({{circa|347 BC}}). Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of [[Philip II of Macedon]], tutored his son [[Alexander the Great]] beginning in 343 BC. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on [[papyrus]] [[scrolls]].

Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around [[Works of Aristotle|a third of his original output has survived]], none of it intended for publication. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was above all from his teachings that [[Western culture|the West]] inherited its intellectual [[lexicon]], as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.

Aristotle's views profoundly shaped [[medieval philosophy|medieval scholarship]]. The influence of [[Aristotelian physics|physical science]] extended from [[late antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]] into the [[Renaissance]], and were not replaced systematically until [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] and theories such as [[classical mechanics]] were developed. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], such as on the [[Hectocotylus|hectocotyl (reproductive) arm]] of the [[octopus]], were disbelieved until the 19th century. He influenced [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400)|Judeo-Islamic philosophies]] during the Middle Ages, as well as [[Christian theology]], especially the [[Neoplatonism]] of the [[Early Church]] and the [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition of the [[Catholic Church]]. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as &quot;The First Teacher&quot;, and among medieval Christians like [[Thomas Aquinas]] as simply &quot;The Philosopher&quot;, while the poet [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] called him &quot;the master of those who know&quot;. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, and were studied by medieval scholars such as [[Peter Abelard]] and [[Jean Buridan]]. Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. In addition, his [[Aristotelian ethics|ethics]], though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of [[virtue ethics]].

It was inspired by the time that Gershwin had spent in [[Paris]] and evokes the sights and energy of the French capital during the ''{{Lang|fr|[[Années folles]]}}''.

Gershwin scored the piece for the standard instruments of the [[symphony orchestra]] plus [[celesta]], saxophones, and automobile horns. He brought back four Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition, which took place on December 13, 1928, in [[Carnegie Hall]], with [[Walter Damrosch]] conducting the [[New York Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf |title=Rhapsody in Blue for Piano and Orchestra : An American in Paris |author=George Gershwin |website=Nyphil.org |access-date=April 6, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052949/http://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/program-notes/1314/Gershwin-An%20American%20in%20Paris.pdf |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |url-status=dead }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://nyphil.org/~/media/pdfs/newsroom/1314/Releases/gilbert-ozone-final.pdf Alan Gilbert and the New York Philharmonic: Makoto Ozone to Perform Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' in One-Night-Only Concert All-American Program Also to Include Bernstein's ''Candide'' Overture and Symphonic Dances from ''West Side Story'' Gershwin's ''An American in Paris'': April 22, 2014 at nyphil.org] Accessed June 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; It was Damrosch who had commissioned Gershwin to write his [[Concerto in F (Gershwin)|Concerto in F]] following the earlier success of ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' (1924).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/An-American-in-Paris-by-Gershwin &quot;''An American in Paris''&quot;], by Betsy Schwarm, ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&amp;composition_id=2983 | title = ''An American in Paris'': About the Work | publisher = [[The Kennedy Center]] | author=Richard Freed|author-link=Richard Freed| access-date=December 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He collaborated on the original program notes with critic and composer [[Deems Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The George Gershwin Reader|editor1-last=Wyatt|editor1-first=Robert|editor2-last=Johnson|editor2-first=John Andrew|date=2004|author=[[Deems Taylor]]|chapter=33.

The '''Academy Award for Best Production Design''' recognizes achievement for [[art direction]] in [[film]]. The category's original name was '''Best Art Direction''', but was changed to its current name in 2012 for the [[85th Academy Awards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Music Rules&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2012/20120830.html |title=Music Rules Approved for 85th Academy Awards |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004163009/http://www.oscars.org/press/pressreleases/2012/20120830.html |archive-date=2014-10-04 |access-date=2012-08-31 |work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change resulted from the Art Directors' branch of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS) being renamed the Designers' branch. Since [[19th Academy Awards|1947]], the award is shared with the set decorators. It is awarded to the best interior design in a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandshows.com/features/best-art-direction-10.html |title=Academy Award for Best Art Direction |website=Awardsandshows.com |access-date=June 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International Atomic Time''' (abbreviated '''TAI''', from its French name '''{{lang|fr|temps atomique international}}'''&lt;ref&gt;Temps atomique 1975{{elucidate|date=April 2020}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a high-precision [[Atomic clock|atomic]] [[coordinate time|coordinate]] [[time standard]] based on the notional passage of [[proper time]] on Earth's [[geoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Is the International Atomic Time TAI a coordinate time or a proper time?|journal=Celestial Mechanics|volume=38|issue=2|pages=155–161 |bibcode=1986CeMec..38..155G|last1=Guinot|first1=B.|year=1986|doi=10.1007/BF01230427|s2cid=120564915}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAI is a [[weighted average]] of the time kept by over 450 [[atomic clock]]s in over 80 national laboratories worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time n.d.&quot; /&gt; It is a continuous scale of time, without [[leap seconds]], and it is the principal realisation of [[Terrestrial Time]] (with a fixed offset of [[epoch (astronomy)|epoch]]). It is the basis for [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface and which has leap seconds.

UTC deviates from TAI by a number of whole seconds. {{as of|2017|01|01}}, when another [[leap second]] was put into effect,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin C 52&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/bul/bulc/bulletinc.52|first=Christian|last=Bizouard|title=Bulletin C 52|lang=en|publisher=[[IERS]]|location=Paris|date=6 July 2016|access-date=31 December 2016|archive-date=13 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813224025/https://hpiers.obspm.fr/eoppc/bul/bulc/bulletinc.52|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; UTC is currently exactly 37 seconds behind TAI. The 37 seconds result from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 27 leap seconds in UTC since 1972.

TAI may be reported using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both [[Julian day]]s and the [[Gregorian calendar]] are used. TAI in this form was synchronised with [[Universal Time]] at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due primarily to the slowing rotation of the Earth.

[[File:Belisaire demandant l'aumone Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|Giving [[alms]] to the poor is often considered an altruistic action.]]

'''Altruism''' is the [[moral principle|principle]] and [[moral behavior|practice]] of concern for the [[well-being]] and/or [[happiness]] of other [[human]]s or animals. While objects of altruistic concern vary, it is an important moral value in many cultures and religions. It may be considered a synonym of selflessness, the opposite of [[selfishness]].

The word ''altruism'' was popularized (and possibly coined) by the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in French, as {{lang|fr|altruisme}}, for an [[antonym]] of [[egoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref2
|1={{cite web |title=altruism (n .) |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=altruism |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Douglas Harper |access-date=27 May 2021}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He derived it from the Italian {{lang|it|altrui}}, which in turn was derived from Latin {{lang|la|alteri}}, meaning &quot;[[alterity|other people]]&quot; or &quot;somebody else&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ciciloni|first=Ferdinando|title=A Grammar of the Italian Language|date=1825|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/agrammaritalian00cicigoog/page/n81 64]|url=https://archive.org/details/agrammaritalian00cicigoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altruism, as observed in populations of organisms, is when an individual performs an action at a cost to themselves (in terms of e.g. pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction) that benefits, directly or indirectly, another individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action.

Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of [[loyalty]] or concern for the [[common good]]. The latter are predicated upon social relationships, whilst altruism does not consider relationships. Whether &quot;true&quot; altruism is possible in human psychology is a subject of debate. The theory of [[psychological egoism]] suggests that no act of sharing, helping, or sacrificing can be truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal [[gratification]]. The validity of this argument depends on whether such [[Motivation#Incentive theories: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic rewards]] qualify as &quot;benefits&quot;.

The term ''[[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]'' may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with [[ethical egoism|egoism]], which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first.

[[Effective altruism]] is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others.

Born and educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] plays, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. In 1957, Rand published her best-selling work, the novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''. Afterward, until her death in 1982, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own [[Objectivist periodicals|periodicals]] and releasing several collections of essays.

Rand advocated [[reason]] and rejected [[faith]] and religion. She supported [[Rational egoism|rational]] and [[ethical egoism]] as opposed to [[Altruism (ethics)|altruism]]. In politics, she condemned the [[initiation of force]] as immoral and supported ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]], which she defined as the system based on recognizing [[individual rights]], including [[private property]] rights. Although Rand opposed [[libertarianism]], which she viewed as [[anarchism]], she is often associated with the modern [[libertarian movement in the United States]]. In art, Rand promoted [[romantic realism]]. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, with a few exceptions.

Rand's books have sold over 37 million copies. Her fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics, with reviews becoming more negative for her later work.{{sfn|Gladstein|1999|pp=117–119}} Although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death,{{sfn|Cocks|2020|p=15}} academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, arguing that she has a polemical approach and that her work lacks methodological rigor.{{sfn|Badhwar|Long|2020}} Her writings have politically influenced some [[right-libertarians]] and [[conservatives]]. The [[Objectivist movement]] circulates her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings.

Algeria is bordered to [[Algeria–Tunisia border|the northeast]] by [[Tunisia]]; to [[Algeria–Libya border|the east]] by [[Libya]]; to [[Algeria–Niger border|the southeast]] by [[Niger]]; to [[Algeria–Western Sahara border|the southwest]] by [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Western Sahara]]; to [[Algeria–Morocco border|the west]] by [[Morocco]]; and to the north by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is considered part of the [[Maghreb]] region of North Africa. It has a semi-arid geography, with most of the population living in the [[Soil fertility|fertile]] north and the [[Sahara]] dominating the geography of the south. Algeria covers an area of {{convert|2381741|km2|sqmi|0}}, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|tenth largest nation by area]], and the [[List of African countries by area|largest nation in Africa]], more than 200 times as large as the continent's smallest country, [[The Gambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Africa: largest countries by area 2020|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/1207844/largest-countries-in-africa-by-area/|access-date=9 February 2022|website=Statista|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a population of 44 million, Algeria is the [[List of African countries by population|tenth-most populous country]] in [[Africa]], and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|32nd-most populous country]] in the world. The capital and [[List of cities in Algeria|largest city]] is [[Algiers]], located in the far north on the Mediterranean coast.

Algeria produced and is linked to many civilizations, empires and dynasties, including [[Numidia]]ns, [[Mauretania]]ns, [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]], [[Mauro-Roman Kingdom|Mauro-Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], [[Emirate of Tlemcen|Ifranids]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]], [[Rustamid dynasty|Rustamids]], [[Idrisid dynasty|Idrisids]], [[Sulaymanid dynasty|Sulaymanids]], [[Aghlabids]], [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]], [[Zirid dynasty|Zirids]], [[Hammadid dynasty|Hammadids]], [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravids]], [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], [[Marinid dynasty|Marinids]], [[Hafsids of Béjaïa|Hafsids]] and the [[Zayyanid dynasty|Zayyanids]].

Centuries of [[Arab migration to the Maghreb]] since the 7th century shifted the demographic scope in Algeria. The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish expansionism]] led to the establishment of the [[Regency of Algiers]] in 1516, a state that attracted people from all over the Mediterranean, making its capital Algiers one of the largest, wealthiest, and most cosmopolitan cities in the world. Its decline in the 19th century resulted in its [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830|invasion]] by the French in 1830. The [[French conquest of Algeria|conquest and pacification]] of the country that ensued lasted until 1903 and led to Algeria becoming an integral part of France in 1848 and home to over a million [[Pied-Noir|European settlers]]. The [[Sétif and Guelma massacre]] in 1945 marked a turning point in Franco-Algerian relations and sparked the [[Algerian War]] which concluded with Algeria [[Independence Day (Algeria)|gaining its independence]] on 5 July 1962 and the proclamation of the People's Democratic Republic on 25 September of that year.

The official languages of Algeria are [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]] and [[Standard Algerian Berber|Berber]]. The majority of Algeria's population is [[Arabs|Arab]], practicing [[Islam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA&quot; /&gt; The native [[Algerian Arabic]] is the main spoken language. [[French language in Algeria|French]] also serves as an administrative and educational language in some contexts, but it has no official status.

Algeria is a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential republic]], with local constituencies consisting of [[Provinces of Algeria|58 provinces]] and [[Communes of Algeria|1,541 communes]]. Algeria is a [[regional power]] in North Africa, and a [[middle power]] in global affairs. It has the highest [[Human Development Index]] of all continental African countries and one of the [[List of African countries by GDP (nominal)|largest economies on the continent]], based largely on energy exports. Algeria has the world's [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|sixteenth-largest oil reserves]] and the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|ninth-largest reserves]] of [[natural gas]]. [[Sonatrach]], the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa, supplying large amounts of [[natural gas]] to Europe. [[Algerian People's National Armed Forces|Algeria's military]] is one of the largest in Africa, and has the largest defence budget on the continent. It is a member of the [[African Union]], the [[Arab League]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]], [[OPEC]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], of which it is a founding member.

It exists in many cultures (China, India, Islam; in the Western world since Hellenistic times) under different specifications: aiming at the production of gold and/or other perfect substances from baser ones, or of the elixir that prolongs life, or even of life itself. Because of its purpose, the alchemists' quest is always strictly linked to the religious doctrine of redemption current in each civilization where alchemy is practiced.&lt;br/&gt; In the Western world alchemy presented itself at its advent as a sacred art. But when, after a long detour via Byzantium and Islamic culture, it came back again to Europe in the twelfth century, adepts designated themselves philosophers. Since then alchemy has confronted natural philosophy for several centuries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its Western form, alchemy is first attested in a number of [[pseudepigraphical]] texts written in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Greco-Roman Egypt]] during the first few centuries AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot;&gt;Principe, Lawrence M. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sR2qKWpO-ssC&amp;q=egypt&amp;pg=PR5 The secrets of alchemy]''. University of Chicago Press, 2012, pp. 9–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic and European alchemists developed a basic set of [[laboratory techniques]], theories, and terms, some of which are still in use today. They did not abandon the [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek philosophical]] idea that everything is composed of [[four elements]], and they tended to guard their work in secrecy, often making use of [[History of cryptography|cyphers]] and cryptic symbolism. In Europe, the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|12th-century translations]] of [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|medieval Islamic works on science]] and the [[Recovery of Aristotle|rediscovery of Aristotelian philosophy]] gave birth to a flourishing tradition of Latin alchemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Routledge&quot;/&gt; This late medieval tradition of alchemy would go on to play a significant role in the development of [[Early modern era|early modern]] science (particularly [[History of chemistry|chemistry]] and [[History of medicine|medicine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor-last=Eddy |editor-first=Matthew Daniel |editor2-last=Mauskopf |editor2-first=Seymour |editor3-last=Newman |editor3-first=William R. |display-editors=0 |ref={{harvid|''CKEMW''|2014}} |title=Chemical Knowledge in the Early Modern World |journal=Osiris |volume=29 |pages=1–15 |date=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/6629576 |last1=Newman |first1=William R. |last2=Mauskopf |first2=Seymour H. |last3=Eddy |first3=Matthew Daniel |pmid=26103744 |doi=10.1086/678110 |s2cid=29035688 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its [[exoteric]] practical applications and its [[esoteric]] spiritual aspects, despite criticisms by scholars such as [[Eric John Holmyard|Eric J. Holmyard]] and [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] that they should be understood as complementary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holmyard|1957|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FRAALC97&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|von Franz|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former is pursued by [[History of the physical sciences|historians of the physical sciences]], who examine the subject in terms of [[History of chemistry|early chemistry]], [[History of medicine|medicine]], and [[charlatanism]], and the [[philosophical]] and [[Religion|religious]] contexts in which these events occurred. The latter interests historians of [[esotericism]], [[History of psychology|psychologists]], and some philosophers and [[Spirituality|spiritualists]]. The subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts.

An '''astronomer''' is a [[scientist]] in the field of [[astronomy]] who focuses their studies on a specific question or field outside the scope of [[Earth]]. They observe [[astronomical object]]s such as [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[natural satellite|moons]], [[comet]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] – in either [[observational astronomy|observational]] (by analyzing the data) or [[theoretical astronomy]]. Examples of topics or fields astronomers study include [[planetary science]], [[Sun|solar astronomy]], the [[Star formation|origin]] or [[stellar evolution|evolution of stars]], or the [[galaxy formation and evolution|formation of galaxies]].

Because of technical limitations of computer systems at the time it was invented, ASCII has just 128 [[code point]]s, of which only 95 are {{Pslink|printable characters}}, which severely limited its scope.

'''Animation''' is the method that encompasses myriad filmmaking techniques, by which [[image|still images]] are manipulated to create [[Motion picture|moving images]]. In [[traditional animation]], images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets ([[cel]]s) to be photographed and exhibited on film. Animation has been recognized as an artistic medium, specifically within the [[Entertainment|entertainment industry]]. Many animations are [[Computer animation|computer animations]] made with [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI). [[Stop motion animation]], in particular [[claymation]], has continued to exist alongside these other forms. 

Animation is contrasted with [[live-action film]], although the two do not exist in isolation. Many moviemakers have produced [[Films with live action and animation|films that are a hybrid of the two]]. As CGI increasingly [[Photorealism|approximates photographic imagery]], filmmakers can easily [[Compositing|composite]] 3D animations into their film rather than using [[Practical effect|practical effects]] for showy [[visual effects]] (VFX).

Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the [[Sun]] and light, poetry, and more. One of the most important and complex of the Greek gods, he is the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Leto]], and the twin brother of [[Artemis]], goddess of the hunt. He is considered to be the most beautiful god and is represented as the ideal of the ''[[kouros]]'' (ephebe, or a beardless, athletic youth). Apollo is known in Greek-influenced [[Etruscan mythology]] as ''[[Apulu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Krauskopf, I. 2006. &quot;The Grave and Beyond.&quot; ''The Religion of the Etruscans.'' edited by N. de Grummond and E. Simon. Austin: University of Texas Press. p. vii, p. 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the patron deity of [[Delphi]] (''Apollo Pythios''), Apollo is an [[oracular]] god—the prophetic [[deity]] of the [[Pythia|Delphic Oracle]] and also the deity of ritual purification. His oracles were often consulted for guidance in various matters. He was in general seen as the god who affords help and wards off evil, and is referred to as {{transliteration|grc|[[Alexicacus]]}}, the &quot;averter of evil&quot;.

Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son [[Asclepius]]. Apollo delivered people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill health and deadly [[Plague (disease)|plague]] with his arrows. The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden bow and a quiver of silver or golden arrows.

As the god of ''mousike'',{{efn|''Mousike'' (the art of the Muses) was an integral part of life in the ancient Greek world, and the term covered not only music but also dance, lyrics, theatre and the performance of poetry.}} Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. The lyre is a common [[#Attributes and symbols|attribute of Apollo]]. Protection of the young is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. As a {{transliteration|grc|[[kourotrophos]]}}, Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children, and he presided over their passage into adulthood. Long hair, which was the prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age ({{transliteration|grc|ephebeia}}) and dedicated to Apollo. The god himself is depicted with long, uncut hair to symbolise his eternal youth.

Apollo is an important pastoral deity, and was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, pests and predators were his primary rustic duties. On the other hand, Apollo also encouraged the founding of new towns and the establishment of civil constitutions, is associated with dominion over [[Colonies in antiquity|colonists]], and was the giver of laws. His oracles were often consulted before setting laws in a city. Apollo [[Agyieus]] was the protector of the streets, public places and home entrances.

In Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as ''Apollo Helios'' he became identified among Greeks with [[Helios]], the personification of the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;For the iconography of the Alexander–Helios type, see H. Hoffmann, 1963. &quot;Helios&quot;, in ''Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt'' '''2''', pp. 117–23; cf. Yalouris 1980, no. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin texts, however, there was no [[conflation]] of Apollo with [[Sol (Roman mythology)|Sol]] among the classical Latin poets until 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fontenrose, &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Latin poets of the first century BC&quot;, ''Transactions of the American Philological Association'' '''30''' (1939), pp 439–55; &quot;Apollo and the Sun-God in Ovid&quot;, ''American Journal of Philology'' '''61''' (1940) pp 429–44; and &quot;Apollo and Sol in the Oaths of Aeneas and Latinus&quot; ''Classical Philology'' '''38'''.2 (April 1943), pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo and Helios/Sol remained separate beings in literary and mythological texts until the 5th century CE.

The '''Austroasiatic languages'''{{refn|group=note|Sometimes also ''Austro-Asiatic'' or ''Austroasian''}} {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɒ|s|t|r|oʊ|.|eɪ|ʒ|i|ˈ|æ|t|ɪ|k|,_|ˌ|ɔː|-}} {{respelling|OSS|troh|ay|zee|AT|ik|,_|AWSS-}} are a large [[language family]] spoken throughout [[mainland Southeast Asia]], [[South Asia]] and [[East Asia]]. These languages are natively spoken by the majority of the population in [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]], and by minority populations scattered throughout parts of [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[India]], [[Myanmar]], [[Malaysia]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], and [[southern China]]. Approximately 117 million people speak an Austroasiatic language, of which more than two-thirds are [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.languagesgulper.com/eng/Austroasiatic.html|title=Austroasiatic|website=www.languagesgulper.com|language=en|access-date=15 October 2017|archive-date=29 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329085717/http://languagesgulper.com/eng/Austroasiatic.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Austroasiatic languages, only Vietnamese, [[Khmer language|Khmer]], and [[Mon language|Mon]] have lengthy, established presences in the  historical record. Only two are presently considered to be the [[national language]]s of sovereign states: Vietnamese in Vietnam, and Khmer in Cambodia. The Mon language is a recognized indigenous language in Myanmar and Thailand, while  the [[Wa language]] is a 'recognized national language' in the de facto autonomous [[Wa State]] within Myanmar. [[Santali language|Santali]] is one of [[Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India|the 22 scheduled languages of India]]. The remainder of the family's languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status.

''[[Ethnologue]]'' identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages. These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps [[Shompen language|Shompen]], which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as Mon–Khmer,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2012) notes, ''MK in the wider sense including the Munda languages of eastern South Asia is also known as Austroasiatic.''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Munda languages|Munda]]. However, one recent classification posits three groups (Munda, Mon-Khmer, and [[Khasi–Palaungic languages|Khasi–Khmuic]]),&lt;ref&gt;Diffloth 2005&lt;/ref&gt; while another has abandoned Mon–Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it synonymous with the larger family.&lt;ref&gt;Sidwell 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Austroasiatic languages appear to be the extant [[Indigenous language|autochthonous languages]] in mainland Southeast Asia, with the neighboring [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]], [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong-Mien]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] having arrived via later migrations.&lt;ref name=&quot;SidwellBlench2011&quot; /&gt;

The '''Afroasiatic languages''' (or '''Afro-Asiatic''', sometimes '''Afrasian'''), also known as '''Hamito-Semitic''' or '''Semito-Hamitic''', are a [[language family]] (or &quot;phylum&quot;) of about 400 languages spoken predominantly in [[West Asia]], [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and parts of the [[Sahara]] and [[Sahel]].{{sfn|Almansa-Villatoro|Štubňová Nigrelli|2023|p=3}} Over 500 million people are native speakers of an Afroasiatic language, constituting the fourth-largest language family after [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], and [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]].{{sfn|Eberhard|Simons|Fennig|2021|loc=Summary by language family}} Most linguists divide the family into six branches: [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Chadic languages|Chadic]], [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]], [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], [[Semitic languages|Semitic]], and [[Omotic languages|Omotic]].{{sfn|Sands|2009|p=565}} The vast majority of Afroasiatic languages are considered indigenous to the [[Africa|African continent]], including all those not belonging to the Semitic branch.

[[Arabic]], if counted as a single language, is by far the most widely spoken within the family, with around 300 million native speakers concentrated primarily in the [[Middle East]] and North Africa.{{sfn|Almansa-Villatoro|Štubňová Nigrelli|2023|p=3}} Other major Afroasiatic languages include the Chadic [[Hausa language]] with over 34 million native speakers, the Semitic [[Amharic language]] with 34 million, and the Cushitic [[Somali language]] with 22 million. Other Afroasiatic languages with millions of native speakers include the Cushitic [[Sidaama language]], the Semitic [[Tigrinya language]] and the Omotic [[Wolaitta language]], though most languages within the family are much smaller in size.{{sfn|Meyer|Wolff|2019|p=249}} There are many well-attested Afroasiatic languages from antiquity that have since [[Extinct language|died or gone extinct]], including Egyptian and the Semitic languages [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Biblical Hebrew]], [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], [[Amorite language|Amorite]], and [[Ugaritic]]. There is no consensus among [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] as to precisely where or when the common ancestor of all Afroasiatic languages, known as [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afroasiatic]], was originally spoken. However, most agree that the Afroasiatic homeland was located somewhere in northeastern Africa, with specific proposals including the Horn of Africa, Egypt, the eastern Sahara. A significant minority of scholars argues for an origin in the [[Levant]]. The reconstructed timelines of when Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken vary extensively, with dates ranging from 18,000 BC to 8,000 BC. Even the latest plausible dating makes Afroasiatic the oldest language family accepted by contemporary linguists.{{sfn|Nichols|2003|p=300}}

Comparative study of Afroasiatic is hindered by the massive disparities in textual attestation between its branches: while the Semitic and Egyptian branches are attested in writing as early as the [[fourth millennium BC]], Berber, Cushitic, and Omotic languages were often not recorded until the 19th or 20th centuries.{{sfn|Gragg|2019|p=41}} While systematic [[comparative method|sound laws]] have not yet been established to explain the relationships between the various branches of Afroasiatic, the languages share a number of common features. One of the most important for establishing membership in the branch is a common set of pronouns.{{sfn|Güldemann|2018|p=315-316}} Other widely shared features include a prefix m- which creates nouns from verbs, evidence for alternations between the vowel &quot;a&quot; and a high vowel in the forms of the verb, similar methods of marking gender and plurality, and some details of phonology such as the presence of [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal fricatives]]. Other features found in multiple branches include a specialized verb conjugation using suffixes (Egyptian, Semitic, Berber), a specialized verb conjugation using prefixes (Semitic, Berber, Cushitic), verbal prefixes deriving [[middle voice|middle]] (t-), [[causative]] (s-), and [[passive voice|passive]] (m-) verb forms (Semitic, Berber, Egyptian, Cushitic), and a suffix used to derive adjectives (Egyptian, Semitic).

The term &quot;arithmetic mean&quot; is preferred in some mathematics and statistics contexts because it helps distinguish it from other types of means, such as [[geometric mean|geometric]] and [[harmonic mean|harmonic]].

In addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is frequently used in [[economics]], [[anthropology]], [[history]], and almost every academic field to some extent. For example, [[per capita income]] is the arithmetic average income of a nation's population.

While the arithmetic mean is often used to report [[central tendency|central tendencies]], it is not a [[robust statistic]]: it is greatly influenced by [[outlier]]s (values much larger or smaller than most others). For [[skewed distribution]]s, such as the [[distribution of income]] for which a few people's incomes are substantially higher than most people's, the arithmetic mean may not coincide with one's notion of &quot;middle&quot;. In that case, robust statistics, such as the [[median]], may provide a better description of central tendency.

The '''American Football Conference''' ('''AFC''') is one of the two [[Athletic conference|conferences]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the highest professional level of American football in the United States. The AFC and its counterpart, the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC), each contain 16 teams with 4 divisions. Both conferences were created as part of the [[AFL–NFL merger|1970 merger]] between the National Football League, and the [[American Football League]] (AFL). All ten of the AFL teams, and three NFL teams, became members of the new AFC, with the remaining thirteen NFL teams forming the NFC.

'''''Animal Farm''''' is a [[beast fable]],{{sfn|Meija|2002}} in the form of a [[Satire|satirical]] [[allegory|allegorical]] [[novella]], by [[George Orwell]], first published in England on 17 August 1945.{{sfn|Bynum|2012}}{{sfn|12 Things You|2015}} It tells the story of a group of [[anthropomorphic]] [[farm animals]] who rebel against their human farmer, hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal, free, and happy. Ultimately, the rebellion is betrayed, and under the [[dictatorship]] of a pig named [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before.

According to Orwell, ''Animal Farm'' reflects events leading up to the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and then on into the [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–53)|Stalinist era]] of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Meija|2002}}{{sfn|Gcse English Literature}} Orwell, a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]],{{sfn|Orwell |2014 |p=23}} was a critic of [[Joseph Stalin]] and hostile to Moscow-directed [[Stalinism]], an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Barcelona [[May Days]] conflicts between the [[POUM]] and Stalinist forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Bowker |2013|p=235}}{{efn| Orwell, writing in his review of [[Franz Borkenau]]'s ''[[The Spanish Cockpit]]'' in ''[[Time and Tide (magazine)|Time and Tide]]'', 31 July 1937, and &quot;Spilling the Spanish Beans&quot;, ''New English Weekly'', 29 July 1937}} In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as a satirical tale against Stalin (&quot;''{{lang|fr|un conte satirique contre Staline}}''&quot;),{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay &quot;[[Why I Write]]&quot; (1946), wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, &quot;to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole&quot;.{{sfn|Orwell|2014|p=10}}

The original title was '''''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story''''', but US publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime, the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] version, kept it. Other title variations include subtitles like &quot;A Satire&quot; and &quot;A Contemporary Satire&quot;.{{sfn|Davison|2000}} Orwell suggested the title ''{{lang|fr|Union des républiques socialistes animales}}'' for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the [[Latin]] word for &quot;bear&quot;, a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]]. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, ''{{lang|fr|Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques}}''.{{sfn |Davison|2000|p=}}

Orwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the United Kingdom was in its [[Allies of World War II|wartime alliance]] with the Soviet Union against [[Nazi Germany]], and the British intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated.{{efn|[[Bradbury, Malcolm]], Introduction |p=vi, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin, 1989}} The manuscript was initially rejected by several British and American publishers,{{sfn|''Animal Farm'': Sixty}} including one of Orwell's own, [[Victor Gollancz]], which delayed its publication. It became a great commercial success when it did appear as international relations and public opinion were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Dickstein |2007 |p= 134}}

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]],{{Sfn|Modern Library|1998}} and number 46 on the [[BBC]]'s [[The Big Read]] poll.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/bigread/top100.shtml &quot;The Big Read&quot;.] BBC.

'''Amphibians''' are [[tetrapod|four-limbed]] and [[ectotherm]]ic [[vertebrate]]s of the [[Class (biology)|class]] '''Amphibia'''. All living amphibians belong to the group [[Lissamphibia]]. They inhabit a wide variety of [[habitat]]s, with most species living within [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[fossorial]], [[arboreal]] or freshwater [[aquatic ecosystems]]. Thus amphibians typically start out as [[larva]]e living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this.

The young generally undergo [[metamorphosis]] from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with [[lung]]s. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial [[salamander]]s and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to [[reptile]]s like [[lizard]]s, but unlike reptiles and other [[amniote]]s, require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often [[ecological indicator]]s; in recent decades there has been a dramatic [[decline in amphibian populations]] for many species around the globe.

The earliest amphibians [[evolution of tetrapods|evolved]] in the [[Devonian]] period from [[sarcopterygian]] fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. The origin of modern amphibians belonging to Lissamphibia, which first appeared during the Early Triassic, around 250 million years ago, has long been contentious. However the emerging consensus is that they likely originated from [[temnospondyls]], the most diverse group of prehistoric amphibians, during the Permian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkins-2019&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Atkins |first1=Jade B. |last2=Reisz |first2=Robert R. |last3=Maddin |first3=Hillary C. |date=March 22, 2019 |title=Braincase simplification and the origin of lissamphibians |journal=PLOS ONE|language=en |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=e0213694 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0213694 |issn=1932-6203 |pmc=6430379 |pmid=30901341 |bibcode=2019PLoSO..1413694A |quote=...there has been a growing consensus that lissamphibians are a monophyletic assemblage derived from within Temnospondyli, and more specifically from within the amphibamid dissorophoids.|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three modern orders of amphibians are [[Anura (frog)|Anura]] (the frogs), [[Urodela]] (the salamanders), and [[caecilian|Apoda]] (the caecilians). A fourth group, the [[Albanerpetontidae]], became extinct around 2 million years ago. The number of known amphibian species is approximately 8,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs. The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from [[New Guinea]] (''[[Paedophryne amauensis]]'') with a length of just {{convert|7.7|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The largest living amphibian is the {{convert|1.8|m|0|abbr=on}} [[South China giant salamander]] (''Andrias sligoi''), but this is dwarfed by prehistoric temnospondyls such as ''[[Mastodonsaurus]]'' which could reach up to {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Back to school: temno superlatives |url=http://bryangee.weebly.com/2/post/2019/09/back-to-school-temno-superlatives.html |access-date=2022-06-29 |website=Bryan Gee, PhD |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of amphibians is called [[batrachology]], while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called [[herpetology]].

'''Alaska''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Alaska.ogg|ə|ˈ|l|æ|s|k|ə}} {{Respell|ə|LAS|kə}}) is a [[Non-contiguous United States|non-contiguous]] [[U.S. state]] on the northwest extremity of [[North America]]. It borders [[British Columbia]] and [[Yukon]] in Canada to the east and it shares a western maritime border in the [[Bering Strait]] with Russia's [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]]. The [[Chukchi Sea|Chukchi]] and [[Beaufort Sea|Beaufort]] Seas of the [[Arctic Ocean]] lie to the north and the [[Pacific Ocean]] lies to the south. Technically a [[enclave and exclave|semi-exclave]] of the U.S., Alaska is the largest exclave in the world.

Alaska is the [[list of U.S. states and territories by area|largest U.S. state]] by area, comprising more total area than the next three largest states of [[Texas]], [[California]] and [[Montana]] combined and is the [[list of country subdivisions by area|seventh-largest subnational division in the world]]. It is the [[list of U.S. states and territories by population|third-least populous]] and [[list of U.S. states and territories by population density|most sparsely populated]] U.S. state, but with a population of 736,081 as of 2020, is the continent's most populous territory located mostly north of the [[60th parallel north|60th parallel]], with more than quadruple the combined populations of [[Northern Canada]] and [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;2020Census&quot; /&gt;  The state capital of [[Juneau, Alaska|Juneau]] is the second-[[list of United States cities by area|largest city in the United States by area]]. The former capital of Alaska, [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], is the largest U.S. city by area. The state's most populous city is [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]].  Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the [[Anchorage metropolitan area]].

[[Alaska Natives|Indigenous people]] have lived in Alaska for thousands of years, and it is widely believed that the region served as [[Settlement of the Americas|the entry point for the initial settlement]] of North America by way of the [[Bering land bridge]]. The [[Russian Empire]] was the first to actively [[European colonization of the Americas|colonize]] the area beginning in the 18th century, eventually establishing [[Russian America]], which spanned most of the current state, and promoted and maintained a native [[Alaskan Creole people|Alaskan Creole]] population.&lt;ref name=&quot;lydiablack&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Russians in Alaska, 1732-1867|author=Lydia Black|publisher=University of Alaska Press|year=2004|pages=217, 218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expense and logistical difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted [[Alaska Purchase|its sale to the U.S.]] in 1867 for US$7.2 million (equivalent to ${{Inflation|USD|7.2|1867}} million in {{Inflation/year|USD}}). The area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a [[territories of the United States|territory]] on May 11, 1912. It was admitted as the 49th state of the U.S. on January 3, 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|year=1959|title=Video: 49th Star.

Abundant natural resources have enabled Alaska&amp;mdash;with one of the smallest state economies&amp;mdash;to have one of the highest [[list of U.S. states by GDP per capita|per capita incomes]], with [[Commercial fishing in Alaska|commercial fishing]], and the extraction of [[Natural gas in Alaska|natural gas]] and oil, dominating [[Economy of Alaska|Alaska's economy]]. U.S. Armed Forces bases and [[tourism in Alaska|tourism]] also contribute to the economy; more than half the state is federally-owned land containing [[United States National Forest|national forests]], [[List of national parks of the United States|national parks]], and [[national wildlife refuge|wildlife refuges]]. It is among the [[List of U.S. states and territories by religiosity|most irreligious states]], one of the first [[2014 Alaska Measure 2|to legalize recreational marijuana]], and is known for its [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarian-leaning]] political culture, generally supporting the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in national elections. The Indigenous population of Alaska is proportionally the highest of any U.S. state, at over 15 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Alaska |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/AK |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229232038/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/AK |archive-date=December 29, 2018 |access-date=February 17, 2020 |website=census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various Indigenous languages are spoken, and Alaskan Natives are influential in local and state politics.

'''Agriculture''' encompasses crop and [[livestock]] production, [[aquaculture]], [[Fishery|fisheries]] and [[forestry]] for food and non-food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://doi.org/10.4060/cb4476en |title=The State of Food and Agriculture 2021.

While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. In the twentieth century, [[industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]]s came to dominate agricultural output.

Today, small [[farm]]s produce about a third of the world's food, but large farms are prevalent.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Lowder |first1=Sarah K. |last2=Sánchez |first2=Marco V. |last3=Bertini |first3=Raffaele |date=2021-06-01 |title=Which farms feed the world and has farmland become more concentrated? |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X2100067X |journal=World Development |language=en |volume=142 |page=105455 |doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2021.105455 |s2cid=233553897 |issn=0305-750X|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest one percent of farms in the world are greater than 50 hectares and operate more than 70 percent of the world's farmland.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; Nearly 40 percent of agricultural land is found on farms larger than 1,000 hectares.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt; However, five of every six farms in the world consist of less than two hectares and take up only around 12 percent of all agricultural land.&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot; /&gt;

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into [[food]]s, [[fiber]]s, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s (such as [[Natural rubber|rubber]]). Food classes include [[cereal]]s ([[grains]]), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil]]s, [[meat]], [[milk]], [[egg]]s, and [[edible mushroom|fungi]]. Global agricultural production amounts to approximately 11 billion tonnes of food,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=FAOSTAT.

Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s, and technological developments have sharply increased [[crop yield]]s, but also contributed to [[Environmental impact of agriculture|ecological and environmental damage]]. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in [[animal husbandry]] have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to [[climate change]], depletion of [[aquifer]]s, [[deforestation]], [[antibiotic resistance]], and [[Agricultural pollution|other agricultural pollution]]. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to [[environmental degradation]], such as [[biodiversity loss]], [[desertification]], [[soil degradation]], and [[climate change]], all of which can cause decreases in crop yield. [[Genetically modified organism]]s are widely used, although [[Regulation of genetic engineering|some countries ban them]].

It is a [[polyphyletic]] grouping that includes species from multiple distinct [[clade]]s. Included organisms range from unicellular [[microalgae]], such as ''[[Chlorella]]'', ''[[Prototheca]]'' and the [[diatom]]s, to [[multicellular]] forms, such as the [[Macrocystis pyrifera|giant kelp]], a large [[brown alga]] which may grow up to {{convert|50|m}} in length. Most are aquatic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as [[stoma]]ta, [[xylem]] and [[phloem]] that are found in [[embryophyte|land plants]]. The largest and most complex marine algae are called [[seaweed]]s, while the most complex freshwater forms are the ''[[Charophyta]]'', a [[phylum|division]] of [[green algae]] which includes, for example, ''[[Spirogyra]]'' and [[stonewort]]s.

Algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants, such as the phyllids (leaf-like structures) of [[bryophyte]]s, [[rhizoid]]s of [[non-vascular plant]]s, and the [[root]]s, [[leaf|leaves]], and other [[Organ (biology)|organs]] found in [[tracheophyte]]s ([[vascular plant]]s). Most are [[phototroph]]ic, although some are [[mixotroph]]ic, deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by [[osmotrophy]], [[Myzocytosis|myzotrophy]], or [[phagocytosis|phagotrophy]]. Some unicellular species of [[green algae]], many [[golden algae]], [[euglenid]]s, [[dinoflagellate]]s, and other algae have become [[heterotroph]]s (also called colorless or apochlorotic algae), sometimes parasitic, relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;Pringsheim, E.

Because of the wide range of types of algae, they have increasing different industrial and traditional applications in human society.

'''Analysis of variance''' ('''ANOVA''') is a collection of [[statistical model]]s and their associated estimation procedures (such as the &quot;variation&quot; among and between groups) used to analyze the differences among means. ANOVA was developed by the [[statistician]] [[Ronald Fisher]]. ANOVA is based on the [[law of total variance]], where the observed [[variance]] in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a [[statistical test]] of whether two or more population [[mean]]s are equal, and therefore generalizes the [[Student's t-test#Independent two-sample t-test|''t''-test]] beyond two means. In other words, the ANOVA is used to test the difference between two or more means.

[[Image:Methane-2D-stereo.svg|right|thumb|Chemical structure of [[methane]], the simplest alkane]]
In [[organic chemistry]], an '''alkane''', or '''paraffin''' (a historical [[trivial name]] that also has [[Paraffin (disambiguation)|other meanings]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;), is an [[Open-chain compound|acyclic]] [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturated]] [[hydrocarbon]]. In other words, an alkane consists of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]] atoms arranged in a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]] structure in which all the [[carbon–carbon bond]]s are [[Single bond|single]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GoldBook alkanes&quot;/&gt; Alkanes have the general chemical formula {{chem2|C_{''n''}H_{2''n''+2} }}. The alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of [[methane]] ({{chem2|CH4}}), where ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (sometimes called the parent molecule), to arbitrarily large and complex molecules, like [[Higher alkanes#Nonatetracontane to tetrapentacontane|pentacontane]] ({{chem2|C50H102}}) or 6-ethyl-2-methyl-5-(1-methylethyl) octane, an [[isomer]] of [[tetradecane]] ({{chem2|C14H30}}).

The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) defines alkanes as &quot;acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula {{chem2|C_{''n''}H_{2''n''+2} }}, and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms&quot;. However, some sources use the term to denote ''any'' saturated hydrocarbon, including those that are either monocyclic (i.e. the [[cycloalkane]]s) or [[polycyclic compound|polycyclic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Core/Organic_Chemistry/Hydrocarbons/Alkanes |title=Alkanes|date=28 November 2016|website = Chemistry LibreTexts}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite their having a distinct general formula (i.e. cycloalkanes are {{chem2|C_{''n''}H_{2''n''} }}).

In an alkane, each carbon atom is [[Orbital hybridisation|sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;-hybridized]] with 4 [[sigma bond]]s (either C–C or [[Carbon–hydrogen bond|C–H]]), and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms (in a C–H bond). The longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its [[Skeletal formula|carbon skeleton]] or carbon backbone. The number of carbon atoms may be considered as the size of the alkane.

One group of the [[higher alkanes]] are [[wax]]es, solids at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard ambient temperature and pressure]] (SATP), for which the number of carbon atoms in the carbon backbone is greater than about 17.
With their repeated –{{chem2|CH2}} units, the alkanes constitute a [[homologous series]] of organic compounds in which the members differ in [[molecular mass]] by multiples of 14.03&amp;nbsp;[[Dalton (unit)|u]] (the total mass of each such [[Methylene bridge|methylene-bridge]] unit, which comprises a single carbon atom of mass 12.01&amp;nbsp;u and two hydrogen atoms of mass ~1.01&amp;nbsp;u each).

Methane is produced by [[Methanogen|methanogenic bacteria]] and some long-chain alkanes function as pheromones in certain animal species or as protective waxes in plants and fungi. Nevertheless, most alkanes do not have much [[biological activity]].  They can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more active/reactive [[functional group]]s of biological molecules.

The alkanes have two main commercial sources: [[petroleum]] (crude oil) and [[natural gas]].

An [[alkyl]] group is an alkane-based molecular fragment that bears one open valence for bonding. They are generally abbreviated with the symbol for any [[organyl group]], R, although Alk is sometimes used to specifically symbolize an alkyl group (as opposed to an alkenyl group or aryl group).

'''United States appellate procedure''' involves the rules and regulations for filing [[appeal]]s in [[state court (United States)|state courts]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. The nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the [[jurisdiction]] where the case was prosecuted. There are many types of [[standard of review]] for appeals, such as ''[[Trial de novo|de novo]]'' and [[abuse of discretion]]. However, most appeals begin when a party files a [[petition for review]] to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower court's decision.

An [[appellate court]] is a [[court]] that hears cases on appeal from another court. Depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance, a party to a [[court case]] who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds. These grounds typically could include errors of law, [[fact]], procedure or due process. In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.

The specific procedures for appealing, including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision, can vary greatly from state to state. The right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state; for example, the [[New Jersey Constitution]] vests judicial power in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, and other courts of limited jurisdiction, with an appellate court being part of the Superior Court.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:2.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Civil procedure (United States)}}

In law, an '''answer''' was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or [[defense (legal)|defense]], a reply to a [[question]] or response, or [[objection (law)|objection]], or a correct solution of a problem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Answer|volume=2|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[common law]], an '''answer''' is the first [[pleading]] by a [[defendant]], usually filed and served upon the [[plaintiff]] within a certain strict time limit after a civil [[complaint]] or criminal [[Information (formal criminal charge)|information]] or [[indictment]] has been served upon the defendant.  It may have been preceded by an ''optional'' &quot;pre-answer&quot; [[motion to dismiss]] or [[demurrer]]; if such a motion is unsuccessful, the defendant ''must'' file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse [[default judgment]].

In a criminal case, there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court.  The pleading in the criminal case, which is entered on the record in open court, is usually either [[guilt (law)|guilt]]y or not guilty. Generally speaking in private, civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence. There is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of [[equitable remedy]] such as [[restitution]] or a permanent [[injunction]]. Criminal cases may lead to [[Fine (penalty)|fine]]s or other [[punishment]], such as [[imprisonment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/resources/law_related_education_network/how_courts_work/pretrial_appearances/|title=How Courts Work|author=&lt;!--Not Stated--&gt;|date=2019-09-09|website=americanbar.org|publisher=American Bar Association|access-date=2020-11-23|quote=The first step is an initial appearance (often referred to as an arraignment), before a judge of a lower court or magistrate, at which the charge is read to the defendant, and penalties explained.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The famous Latin ''Responsa Prudentium'' (&quot;answers of the learned ones&quot;) were the accumulated views of many successive generations of Roman [[lawyer]]s, a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chisholm1911&quot;/&gt;

During debates of a contentious nature, deflection, colloquially known as 'changing the topic', has been widely observed, and is often seen as a failure to answer a question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baaske|first1=Kevin|title=Arguments and Arguing: The Products and Process of Human Decision Making|date=2015|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In much of the world, [[Judiciary|court systems]] are divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears [[Legal case|cases]] and reviews [[Evidence (law)|evidence]] and [[testimony]] to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a [[supreme court]] (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts, often on a [[Discretionary review|discretionary basis]].

Under its [[standard of review]], an appellate court decides the extent of the deference it would give to the lower court's decision, based on whether the appeal were one of fact or of law. In reviewing an issue of fact, an appellate court ordinarily gives deference to the trial court's findings. It is the duty of trial judges or [[jury|juries]] to find facts, view the evidence firsthand, and observe [[Eyewitness testimony|witness testimony]]. When reviewing lower decisions on an issue of fact, courts of appeal generally look for clear error. The appellate court reviews issues of law {{Lang|la|de novo}} (anew, no deference) and may reverse or modify the lower court's decision if the appellate court believes the lower court misapplied the facts or the law. An appellate court may also review the lower judge's discretionary decisions, such as whether the judge properly granted a new trial or disallowed evidence. The lower court's decision is only changed in cases of an &quot;[[abuse of discretion]]&quot;. This standard tends to be even more deferential than the &quot;clear error&quot; standard.

Before hearing any case, the court must have [[jurisdiction]] to consider the appeal.  The authority of appellate courts to review the decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another. In some areas, the appellate court has limited powers of review. Generally, an appellate court's judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified.&lt;ref&gt;State v. Randolph, 210 N.J. 330, 350 n.5 (2012), citing Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books 2012), chapter 28:2&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the type of case and the decision below, appellate review primarily consists of: an entirely new hearing (a non [[trial de novo]]); a hearing where the appellate court gives deference to factual findings of the lower court; or review of particular legal rulings made by the lower court (an appeal on the record).

'''Arraignment''' is a formal reading of a criminal charging document in the presence of the [[defendant]], to inform them of the [[Criminal charge|charges]] against them. In response to arraignment, in some jurisdictions, the accused is expected to enter a [[plea]]; in other jurisdictions, no plea is required. Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions, but they generally include ''[[Guilty (plea)|guilty]]'', ''not guilty'', and the [[peremptory plea]]s, or pleas in bar, setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed. Pleas of ''[[nolo contendere]]'' ('no contest') and the [[Alford plea]] are allowed in some circumstances.

'''Assistive technology''' ('''AT''') is a term for assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for [[Disability|people with disabilities]] and the elderly. Disabled people often have difficulty performing [[activities of daily living]] (ADLs) independently, or even with assistance. ADLs are self-care activities that include toileting, mobility (ambulation), eating, bathing, dressing, grooming, and personal device care. Assistive technology can ameliorate the effects of disabilities that limit the ability to perform ADLs. Assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the [[technology]] needed to accomplish such tasks. For example, wheelchairs provide independent mobility for those who cannot walk, while [[assistive eating devices]] can enable people who cannot feed themselves to do so. Due to assistive technology, disabled people have an opportunity of a more positive and easygoing lifestyle, with an increase in &quot;social participation,&quot; &quot;security and control,&quot; and a greater chance to &quot;reduce institutional costs without significantly increasing household expenses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Parant|first1=Aymeric |last2=Schiano-Lomoriello |first2=Sandrine |last3=Marchan |first3=Francis |date=October 2017|title=How would I live with a disability?

[[File:Abacus_(PSF).png|thumb|[[Bi-quinary coded decimal]]-like abacus representing {{formatnum:1352964708}}]]

The '''abacus''' ({{plural form}}: '''abaci''' or '''abacuses'''), also called a '''counting frame''', is a [[hand]]-operated calculating tool of unknown origin used since [[Ancient history|ancient times]] in the [[ancient Near East]], [[Europe]], [[China]], and [[Russia]], millennia before the adoption of the [[Eastern Arabic numerals|Hindu-Arabic numeral system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer253&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Boyer|Merzbach|1991|pp=252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abacus consists of a two-dimensional array of [[Sliding (motion)|slidable]] [[beads]] (or similar objects). In their earliest designs, the beads could be loose on a flat surface or sliding in grooves. Later the beads were made to slide on rods and built into a frame, allowing faster manipulation.

Each rod typically represents one [[Numerical digit|digit]] of a multi-digit [[number]] laid out using a [[positional numeral system]] such as [[base ten]] (though some cultures used different [[Numerical base|numerical bases]]). [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[East Asian]] abacuses use a system resembling [[bi-quinary coded decimal]], with a top deck (containing one or two beads) representing fives and a bottom deck (containing four or five beads) representing ones. [[Natural numbers]] are normally used, but some allow simple [[Fraction|fractional]] components (e.g. {{Fraction|1|2}}, {{Fraction|1|4}}, and {{Fraction|1|12}} in [[Roman abacus]]), and a [[decimal point]] can be imagined for [[fixed-point arithmetic]].

Any particular abacus design supports multiple methods to perform calculations, including [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], [[Division (mathematics)|division]], and [[square root|square]] and [[cube root]]s. The beads are first arranged to represent a number, then are manipulated to perform a [[mathematical operation]] with another number, and their final position can be read as the result (or can be used as the starting number for subsequent operations).

In the ancient world, abacuses were a practical calculating tool. Although [[calculator]]s and [[computer]]s are commonly used today instead of abacuses, abacuses remain in everyday use in some countries. The abacus has an advantage of not requiring a [[writing implement]] and [[paper]] (needed for [[algorism]]) or an [[electric power source]]. Merchants, traders, and clerks in some parts of [[Eastern Europe]], [[Russia]], [[China]], and [[Africa]] use abacuses. The abacus remains in common use as a scoring system in non-[[Electronics|electronic]] table games. Others may use an abacus due to [[visual impairment]] that prevents the use of a calculator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyer253&quot; /&gt; The abacus is still used to teach the fundamentals of [[mathematics]] to children in most countries.

[[File:Zn reaction with HCl.JPG|thumb|[[Zinc]], a typical metal, reacting with [[hydrochloric acid]], a typical acid]]
{{Acids and bases}}
An '''acid''' is a [[molecule]] or [[ion]] capable of either donating a [[proton]] (i.e. hydrogen ion, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), known as a [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory|Brønsted–Lowry acid]], or forming a [[covalent bond]] with an [[electron pair]], known as a [[Lewis acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC_acid&quot;&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00071.html IUPAC Gold Book - acid]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first category of acids are the proton donors, or [[Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory|Brønsted–Lowry acid]]s. In the special case of [[aqueous solution]]s, proton donors form the [[hydronium ion]] H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and are known as [[Acid–base reaction#Arrhenius theory|Arrhenius acids]]. [[Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted|Brønsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry|Lowry]] generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous [[solvent]]s. A Brønsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

Aqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties that provide a practical description of an acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petrucci |first1=R. H. |last2=Harwood |first2=R. S. |last3=Herring |first3=F. G. |title=General Chemistry: Principles and Modern Applications |date=2002 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-014329-4 |page=146 |edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste, can turn blue [[litmus]] red, and react with [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] and certain metals (like [[calcium]]) to form [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]. The word ''acid'' is derived from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|acidus}}, meaning 'sour'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acid Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''acid'']&lt;/ref&gt; An aqueous solution of an acid has a [[pH]] less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as &quot;acid&quot; (as in &quot;dissolved in acid&quot;), while the strict definition refers only to the [[solute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC_acid&quot;/&gt; A lower pH means a higher '''acidity''', and thus a higher concentration of [[Hydron (chemistry)|positive hydrogen ion]]s in the solution. Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be '''acidic'''.

Common aqueous acids include [[hydrochloric acid]] (a solution of [[hydrogen chloride]] that is found in [[gastric acid]] in the stomach and activates [[digestive enzymes]]), [[acetic acid]] (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), [[sulfuric acid]] (used in [[car battery|car batteries]]), and [[citric acid]] (found in citrus fruits). As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict&lt;ref name=&quot;IUPAC_acid&quot;/&gt; sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases. [[Acid strength|Strong acid]]s and some concentrated weak acids are [[corrosive substance|corrosive]], but there are exceptions such as [[carborane]]s and [[boric acid]].

The second category of acids are [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acids]], which form a covalent bond with an electron pair. An example is [[boron trifluoride]] (BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), whose boron atom has a vacant [[atomic orbital|orbital]] that can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base, for example the nitrogen atom in [[ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Gilbert N. Lewis|Lewis]] considered this as a generalization of the Brønsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly ''or'' by releasing protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) into the solution, which then accept electron pairs. Hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Brønsted–Lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair, however, and are therefore not Lewis acids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxtoby8th&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Otoxby |first1=D. W. |last2=Gillis |first2=H. P. |last3=Butler |first3=L. J. |title=Principles of Modern Chemistry |date=2015 |publisher=Brooks Cole |isbn=978-1305079113 |page=617 |edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, many Lewis acids are not Arrhenius or Brønsted–Lowry acids. In modern terminology, an ''acid'' is implicitly a Brønsted acid and not a Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as ''a Lewis acid''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxtoby8th&quot; /&gt;

'''Bitumen''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|b|ɪ|tj|ʊ|m|ɪ|n}}, {{IPAc-en|us|b|ɪ|ˈ|tj|uː|m|ə|n|,_|b|aɪ|-}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EPD|18}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a sticky, black, highly [[viscosity|viscous]] liquid or semi-solid form of [[petroleum]].

In material sciences and engineering, the terms &quot;asphalt&quot; and &quot;bitumen&quot; are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance, although there is regional variation as to which term is most common. Worldwide, geologists tend to favor the term &quot;bitumen&quot; for the naturally occurring material. For the manufactured material, which is a refined residue from the [[distillation]] process of selected crude oils, &quot;bitumen&quot; is the prevalent term in much of the world; however, in [[American English]], &quot;asphalt&quot; is more commonly used. To help avoid confusion, the phrases &quot;liquid asphalt&quot;, &quot;asphalt binder&quot;, or &quot;asphalt cement&quot; are used in the U.S. Colloquially, various forms of asphalt are sometimes referred to as &quot;[[tar]]&quot;, as in the name of the [[La Brea Tar Pits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=E.R.|last2=Kandhal|first2=P.S.|last3=Roberts|first3=F.L.|last4=Kim|first4=Y.R.|last5=Lee|first5=D.-Y.|last6=Kennedy|first6=T.W.|title=Hot Mix Asphalt Materials, Mixture Design, and Construction|edition=Third|year=1991|publisher=NAPA Education and Research Foundation|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-0-914313-02-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American National Standards Institute''' ('''ANSI''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|s|i}} {{respell|AN|see}}) is a private [[nonprofit organization]] that oversees the development of [[Standardization|voluntary consensus standards]] for products, services, processes, systems, and personnel in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{IETF RFC|4949}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also coordinates U.S. standards with international standards so that American products can be used worldwide.

ANSI accredits standards that are developed by representatives of other [[standards organization]]s, [[government agency|government agencies]], [[consumer organization|consumer groups]], companies, and others. These standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way. ANSI also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI 2009 Annual Report&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's headquarters are in [[Washington, D.C.]] ANSI's operations office is located in [[New York City]]. The ANSI annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications, membership dues and fees, accreditation services, fee-based programs, and international standards programs.

Many ANSI regulations are [[Incorporation by reference|incorporated by reference]] into United States federal statutes (i.e. by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] regulations referring to individual ANSI specifications). ANSI does not make these standards publicly available, and charges money for access to these documents; it further claims that it is [[copyright infringement]] for them to be provided to the public by others free of charge. These assertions have been the subject of criticism and litigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;distcourt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ansi.org/news/standards-news/all-news/2017/02/us-district-court-rules-in-favor-of-copyright-protection-for-standards-incorporated-by-reference-int-13|title=U.S. District Court Rules in Favor of Copyright Protection for Standards Incorporated by Reference into Federal Regulations|author=American National Standards Institute|date=February 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;techdirt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.techdirt.com/2016/07/07/standards-body-whines-that-people-who-want-free-access-to-law-probably-also-want-free-sex/|title=Standards Body Whines That People Who Want Free Access To The Law Probably Also Want 'Free Sex'|author=Mike Masnick|website=Techdirt|date=July 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usgnn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usglassmag.com/2016/09/court-hears-crucial-case-over-access-to-standards/|title=Court Hears Crucial Case Over Access to Standards|author=Trey Barrineau|date=September 13, 2016|website=The USGlass News Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apollo 11''' (July 16–24, 1969) was the American [[Human spaceflight|spaceflight]] that first [[Moon landing|landed]] humans on the [[Moon]]. Commander [[Neil Armstrong]] and Lunar Module Pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]] landed the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] [[Lunar Module Eagle|''Eagle'']] on July 20, 1969, at 20:17 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], and Armstrong became the first person to step onto the Moon's surface six hours and 39 minutes later, on July 21 at 02:56 UTC. Aldrin joined him 19 minutes later, and they spent about two and a quarter hours together exploring the site they had named [[Tranquility Base]] upon landing. Armstrong and Aldrin collected {{convert|47.5|lb|kg}} of lunar material to bring back to Earth as pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] flew the [[Command Module Columbia|Command Module ''Columbia'']] in [[lunar orbit]], and were on the Moon's surface for 21 hours, 36 minutes before lifting off to rejoin ''Columbia''.

Apollo 11 was launched by a [[Saturn V]] rocket from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on [[Merritt Island, Florida]], on July 16 at 13:32 UTC, and it was the fifth crewed mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]]. The Apollo [[Apollo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]] had three parts: a [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module (CM)]] with a cabin for the three astronauts, the only part that returned to Earth; a [[Apollo service module|service module (SM)]], which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module (LM)]] that had two stages—a descent stage for landing on the Moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit.

After being [[Trans-lunar injection|sent to the Moon]] by the Saturn V's third stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into [[Lunar Module Eagle|''Eagle'']] and landed in the [[Sea of Tranquility]] on July 20. The astronauts used ''Eagle''{{'}}s ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned ''Eagle'' before they performed the maneuvers that propelled ''Columbia'' out of the last of its 30 lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to Earth.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|p=109}} They returned to Earth and [[Splashdown|splashed down]] in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 after more than eight days in space.

Armstrong's first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on [[Live television|live TV]] to a worldwide audience. He described the event as &quot;one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.&quot;{{efn|Eric Jones of the ''Apollo Lunar Surface Journal'' explains that the indefinite article &quot;a&quot; was intended, whether or not it was said; the intention was to contrast ''a man'' (an individual's action) and ''mankind'' (as a species).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html#1092413|title=One Small Step|last1=Jones|first=Eric|website=Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Journal|access-date=September 6, 2019|date=April 8, 2018|archive-date=September 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190903233224/https://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11.step.html#1092413|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt;|name=transcript}}&lt;ref name=&quot;ALSJ 4&quot; /&gt; Apollo 11 effectively proved U.S. victory in the [[Space Race]] to demonstrate spaceflight superiority, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F.

The crew orbited the Moon ten times without landing, and then departed safely back to [[Earth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20181221&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |author-link=Dennis Overbye |title=Apollo 8's Earthrise: The Shot Seen Round the World—Half a century ago today, a photograph from the moon helped humans rediscover Earth. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/science/earthrise-moon-apollo-nasa.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220101/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/science/earthrise-moon-apollo-nasa.html |archive-date=2022-01-01 |url-access=limited |date=December 21, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=December 24, 2018 }}{{cbignore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20181224a&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last1=Boulton |first1=Matthew Myer |last2=Heithaus |first2=Joseph |title=We Are All Riders on the Same Planet—Seen from space 50 years ago, Earth appeared as a gift to preserve and cherish.

Apollo 8 launched on December 21, 1968, and was the second [[crewed spaceflight]] mission flown in the United States [[Apollo space program]] after [[Apollo 7|Apollo{{nbsp}}7]], which stayed in Earth orbit. Apollo{{nbsp}}8 was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the [[Saturn V]] rocket, and was the first human spaceflight from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], located adjacent to [[Cape Canaveral Space Force Station|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station]] in Florida.

Originally planned as the second crewed [[Apollo Lunar Module]] and [[Apollo command and service module|command module]] test, to be flown in an elliptical [[medium Earth orbit]] in early 1969, the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious command-module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December, as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight. Astronaut [[Jim McDivitt]]'s crew, who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low Earth orbit, became the crew for the [[Apollo 9|Apollo{{nbsp}}9]] mission, and Borman's crew were moved to the Apollo{{nbsp}}8 mission. This left Borman's crew with two to three months' less training and preparation time than originally planned, and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training.

Apollo 8 took 68 hours to travel the distance to the Moon. The crew orbited the Moon ten times over the course of twenty hours, during which they made a Christmas Eve [[Apollo TV camera|television broadcast]] in which they [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read the first ten verses from]] the [[Book of Genesis]]. At the time, the broadcast was the most watched TV program ever. Apollo{{nbsp}}8's successful mission paved the way for [[Apollo 10]] and, with [[Apollo 11|Apollo{{nbsp}}11]] in July 1969, the fulfillment of U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the decade. The Apollo{{nbsp}}8 astronauts returned to Earth on December 27, 1968, when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern Pacific Ocean. The crew members were named [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]'s [[Time Person of the Year|&quot;Men of the Year&quot;]] for 1968 upon their return. It is the last Apollo mission for which all three crew members are still living.

An '''astronaut''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄστρον}} ({{transliteration|grc|astron}}), meaning 'star', and {{lang|grc|ναύτης}} ({{transliteration|grc|nautes}}), meaning 'sailor') is a person trained, equipped, and deployed by a [[List of human spaceflight programs|human spaceflight program]] to serve as a commander or crew member aboard a [[spacecraft]]. Although generally reserved for professional space travelers, the term is sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space, including [[scientist]]s, [[politician]]s, [[journalist]]s, and [[space tourism|tourists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=NASA|author-link=NASA|year=2006 |title = Astronaut Fact Book |url = http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/astro.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025124047/http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/factsheets/pdfs/astro.pdf |archive-date=25 October 2007 |access-date=4 October 2007 |publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;utah&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.utahstatesman.com/campus_news/1.563784 |title = Former astronaut visits USU |access-date=4 October 2007 |publisher=The Utah Statesman |year=2005 |first = Marie |last = MacKay |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080926175913/http://www.utahstatesman.com/campus_news/1.563784 |archive-date=26 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Astronaut&quot; technically applies to all human space travelers regardless of nationality. However, astronauts fielded by Russia or the [[Soviet Union]] are typically known instead as '''cosmonauts''' (from the Russian &quot;kosmos&quot; (космос), meaning &quot;space&quot;, also borrowed from Greek {{lang|grc|κόσμος}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;vocabulary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/astronaut |title = astronaut - Dictionary Definition : Vocabulary.com |website=vocabulary.com |access-date=9 January 2021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparatively recent developments in crewed spaceflight made by China have led to the rise of the term '''taikonaut''' (from the [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] &quot;tàikōng&quot; ({{lang|zh|太空}}), meaning &quot;space&quot;), although its use is somewhat informal and its origin is unclear. In [[China]], the [[People's Liberation Army Astronaut Corps]] [[List of Chinese astronauts|astronauts]] and their foreign counterparts are all officially called ''hángtiānyuán'' ({{lang|zh-CN|航天员}}, meaning &quot;heaven navigator&quot; or literally &quot;[[Spaceflight|heaven-sailing]] staff&quot;).

Since 1961, 600 astronauts have flown in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://interestingengineering.com/spacexs-crew-3-launched-the-600th-person-to-space-in-60-years|title=SpaceX's Crew-3 Launched the 600th Person to Space in 60 Years|date=11 November 2021}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until 2002, astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments, either by the military or by civilian space agencies. With the suborbital flight of the privately funded [[SpaceShipOne]] in 2004, a new category of astronaut was created: the [[commercial astronaut]].

'''Anarchism''' is a [[political philosophy]] and [[Political movement|movement]] that is skeptical of all justifications for [[authority]] and seeks to abolish the [[institutions]] it claims maintain unnecessary [[coercion]] and [[Social hierarchy|hierarchy]], typically including [[State (polity)|nation states]],{{sfn|Suissa|2019b|ps=: &quot;...as many anarchists have stressed, it is not government as such that they find objectionable, but the hierarchical forms of government associated with the nation state.&quot;}} and [[capitalism]]. Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with [[Stateless society|stateless societies]] and [[Voluntary association|voluntary]] [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|free associations]]. As a historically [[left-wing]] movement, this reading of anarchism is placed on the [[Far-left politics|farthest left]] of the [[political spectrum]], usually described as the [[libertarian]] wing of the [[socialist movement]] ([[libertarian socialism]]).

[[Humans]] have lived in [[society|societies]] without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of states, [[realm]]s, or [[empire]]s. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, [[scepticism]] toward authority also rose. Although traces of anarchist ideas are found all throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for [[emancipation]]. [[Anarchist schools of thought|Various anarchist schools of thought]] formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the [[Paris Commune]], the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Spanish Civil War]], whose end marked the end of the [[classical era of anarchism]]. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more, growing in popularity and influence within [[anti-capitalist]], [[anti-war]] and [[anti-globalisation]] movements.

Anarchists employ [[diversity of tactics|diverse approaches]], which may be generally divided into revolutionary and [[evolutionary strategies]]; there is significant overlap between the two. Evolutionary methods try to simulate what an anarchist society might be like, but revolutionary tactics, which have historically taken a violent turn, aim to overthrow authority and the state. Many facets of human civilization have been influenced by anarchist theory, critique, and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]].

The essay suggests that the impoverished [[Kingdom of Ireland|Irish]] might ease their economic troubles by selling their children [[Human cannibalism|as food]] to rich gentlemen and ladies. This satirical [[hyperbole]] mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor, who were predominantly Irish Catholic (i.e., &quot;Papists&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Swift notes that &quot;the number of Popish infants, is at least three to one in this kingdom, and therefore it will have one another collateral advantage, by lessening the number of Papists among us.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] policy towards the Irish in general.

In English writing, the phrase &quot;a [[wikt:modest proposal|modest proposal]]&quot; is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight-faced satire.

The alkali metals are all shiny, [[hardness|soft]], highly [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] [[metals]] at [[standard temperature and pressure]] and readily lose their [[valence electron|outermost electron]] to form [[cations]] with [[electric charge|charge]] +1. They can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness, exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to [[redox|oxidation]] by atmospheric moisture and [[oxygen]] (and in the case of lithium, [[nitrogen]]). Because of their high reactivity, they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air, and are found naturally only in [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and never as the free elements. Caesium, the fifth alkali metal, is the most reactive of all the metals.&lt;!--YES, NOT FRANCIUM. SEE BELOW.--&gt; All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.

All of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds: in order of [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundance]], sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high [[radioactivity]]; francium occurs only in minute [[trace radioisotope|traces]] in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural [[decay chain]]s. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of [[ununennium|element 119]], which is likely to be the next member of the group; none were successful. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of [[superheavy element]]s; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.

Most alkali metals have many different applications. One of the best-known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in [[atomic clock]]s, of which caesium atomic clocks form the basis of the [[second]]. A common application of the compounds of sodium is the [[sodium-vapour lamp]], which emits light very efficiently. [[Salt|Table salt]], or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. [[Lithium (medication)|Lithium]] finds use as a psychiatric medication and as an [[anode]] in [[lithium batteries]]. Sodium, potassium and lithium are [[essential element]]s, having major biological roles as [[electrolytes]], and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.

[[File:Phoenician alphabet.svg|thumb|The [[Phoenician alphabet]] with corresponding [[Latin script|Latin letters]] ]]

[[Peter T. Daniels]] distinguishes an abugida, a set of graphemes that represent consonantal base letters that [[diacritic]]s modify to represent vowels, like in [[Devanagari]] and other South Asian scripts, an abjad, in which letters predominantly or exclusively represent [[consonant]]s such as the original Phoenician, [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]], and an alphabet, a set of graphemes that represent both consonants and [[vowel]]s. In this narrow sense of the word, the first true alphabet was the Greek alphabet,&lt;ref name=&quot;Blackwell&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Coulmas |first=Florian |title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |year=1996 |isbn=978-0631214816 |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Millard|1986|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was based on the earlier Phoenician abjad.

Alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of letters. This makes them useful for purposes of [[collation]], which allows words to be sorted in a specific order, commonly known as the [[alphabetical order]]. It also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of &quot;numbering&quot; ordered items, in such contexts as [[numbered list]]s and number placements. There are also names for letters in some languages. This is known as [[acrophony]]; It is present in some modern scripts, such as [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], and many Semitic scripts, such as [[Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]]. It was used in some ancient alphabets, such as in [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]]. However, this system is not present in all languages, such as the [[Latin alphabet]], which adds a vowel after a character for each letter. Some systems also used to have this system but later on abandoned it for a system similar to Latin, such as [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].

[[File:Atomic number depiction.svg|thumb|300px|right|An explanation of the superscripts and subscripts seen in atomic number notation. Atomic number is the number of protons, and therefore also the total positive charge, in the atomic nucleus.]]
[[Image:Bohr atom model.svg|thumb|right|300px|The '''Rutherford–Bohr model''' of the [[hydrogen atom]] ({{nowrap|''Z'' {{=}} 1}}) or a hydrogen-like ion ({{nowrap|1=''Z'' &gt; 1}}). In this model it is an essential feature that the photon energy (or frequency) of the electromagnetic radiation emitted (shown) when an electron jumps from one orbital to another be proportional to the mathematical square of atomic charge ({{nowrap|''Z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''}}). Experimental measurement by [[Henry Moseley]] of this radiation for many elements (from {{nowrap|''Z'' {{=}} 13 to 92}}) showed the results as predicted by Bohr. Both the concept of atomic number and the Bohr model were thereby given scientific credence.]]

The '''atomic number''' or '''nuclear charge number''' (symbol ''Z'') of a [[chemical element]] is the [[charge number]] of an [[atomic nucleus]]. For ordinary nuclei composed of [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, this is equal to the '''proton number''' (''n''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) or the number of protons found in the nucleus of every [[atom]] of that element. The atomic number can be used to uniquely identify ordinary [[chemical elements]]. In an ordinary [[electric charge|uncharged]] atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of [[electron]]s.

For an ordinary atom which contains protons, neutrons and [[electron]]s, the sum of the atomic number ''Z'' and the [[neutron number]] ''N'' gives the atom's [[atomic mass number]] ''A''. Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes) and the [[Binding energy#Mass change|mass defect]] of the [[nucleon]] binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the [[atomic mass]] of any atom, when expressed in [[dalton (unit)|daltons]] (making a quantity called the &quot;[[atomic mass|relative isotopic mass]]&quot;), is within 1% of the whole number ''A''.

Atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers, and hence different mass numbers, are known as [[isotope]]s. A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes (see [[monoisotopic element]]s), and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element (called the relative atomic mass) in a defined environment on Earth, determines the element's standard [[atomic weight]]. Historically, it was these atomic weights of elements (in comparison to hydrogen) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century.

The conventional symbol ''Z'' comes from the [[German language|German]] word ''{{lang|de|'''Z'''ahl}}'' 'number', which, before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the [[periodic table]], whose order was then approximately, but not completely, consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights. Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this ''Z'' number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did the word {{lang|de|Atom'''z'''ahl}} (and its English equivalent ''atomic number'') come into common use in this context.

The rules above do not always apply to [[exotic atom]]s which contain short-lived elementary particles other than protons, neutrons and electrons.

'''Anatomy''' ({{etymology|grc|''{{wikt-lang| grc|ἀνατομή}}'' ({{grc-transl|ἀνατομή}})|[[dissection]]}}) is the branch of [[biology]] concerned with the study of the structure of [[organisms]] and their parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|anatomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anatomy is a branch of [[natural science]] that deals with the structural organization of living things.

Anatomy and [[physiology]], which study the structure and [[function (biology)|function]] of organisms and their parts respectively, make a natural pair of related disciplines, and are often studied together. Human anatomy is one of the essential [[basic research|basic sciences]] that are applied in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arráez-Aybar |display-authors=etal |year=2010 |title=Relevance of human anatomy in daily clinical practice |journal=[[Annals of Anatomy]] |volume=192 |issue=6|pages=341–48 |doi=10.1016/j.aanat.2010.05.002 |pmid=20591641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anatomy is a complex and dynamic field that is constantly evolving as new discoveries are made. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of advanced imaging techniques, such as [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] and [[CT scan]]s, which allow for more detailed and accurate visualizations of the body's structures.

The discipline of anatomy is divided into [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] and [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] parts. [[Gross anatomy|Macroscopic anatomy]], or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of [[superficial anatomy]]. Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the [[tissue (biology)|tissues]] of various structures, known as [[histology]], and also in the study of [[cell biology|cells]].

The [[history of anatomy]] is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body. Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by [[dissection]] of carcasses and [[cadaver]]s (corpses)&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ghosh |first=Sanjib Kumar |date=2017-03-02 |title=Human cadaveric dissection: a historical account from ancient Greece to the modern era |journal=Anatomy &amp; Cell Biology |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=153–169 |doi=10.5115/acb.2015.48.3.153 |pmc=4582158 |pmid=26417475}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 20th-century [[medical imaging]] techniques, including [[Radiography|X-ray]], [[Ultrasound imaging|ultrasound]], and [[magnetic resonance imaging]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:1&quot; /&gt;

In [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]], '''affirming the consequent''', sometimes called '''converse error''', '''fallacy of the converse''', or '''confusion of necessity and sufficiency''', is a [[formal fallacy]] of taking a true [[indicative conditional|conditional]] statement (e.g., &quot;if the lamp were broken, then the room would be dark&quot;) under certain assumptions (there are no other lights in the room, it is nighttime and the windows are closed), and invalidly inferring its [[Converse (logic)|converse]] (&quot;the room is dark, so the lamp must be broken&quot;), even though that statement may not be true under the same assumptions. This arises when the [[consequent]] (&quot;the room would be dark&quot;) has other possible [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]s (for example, &quot;the lamp is in working order, but is switched off&quot; or &quot;there is no lamp in the room&quot;).

Converse errors are common in everyday thinking and communication and can result from, among other causes, communication issues, misconceptions about logic, and failure to consider other causes.

The opposite statement, '''denying the consequent''', is called [[modus tollens]] and ''is'' a valid form of argument.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurley2012&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hurley |first=Patrick J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foDDbwAACAAJ |page=362 |title=A Concise Introduction to Logic|date=2012 |isbn=9781111346232 |publisher=Cengage Learning |location=Boston, Massachusetts |oclc=711774631|edition=11th }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarkovsky studied film at Moscow's [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography|VGIK]] under filmmaker [[Mikhail Romm]], and subsequently directed his first five [[feature film|features]] in the [[Soviet Union]]: ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' (1962), ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' (1966), ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' (1972), ''[[Mirror (film)|Mirror]]'' (1975), and ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' (1979). A number of his films from this period are ranked among the [[List of films considered the best|best films ever made]]. After years of creative conflict with [[State Committee for Cinematography|state film authorities]], Tarkovsky left the country in 1979 and made his final two films abroad; ''[[Nostalghia]]'' (1983) and ''[[The Sacrifice (1986 film)|The Sacrifice]]'' (1986) were produced in Italy and Sweden respectively. In 1986, he also published a book about cinema and art entitled ''[[Sculpting in Time]]''. He died later that year of cancer, a condition possibly caused by the toxic locations used in the filming of ''Stalker''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SharunQuote&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Tyrkin |first=Stas |title=In Stalker Tarkovsky foretold Chernobyl |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Stalker/sharun.html |publisher=Nostalghia.com |date=2001-03-23 |access-date=2009-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322094135/https://people.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Stalker/sharun.html |archive-date=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tarkovsky was the recipient of several awards at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] throughout his career, including the [[International Federation of Film Critics|FIPRESCI prize]], the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]], and the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Spécial du Jury]]. He was also awarded the [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] for his debut film, ''Ivan's Childhood''. In 1990, he was posthumously awarded the Soviet Union's prestigious [[Lenin Prize]].

'''Ambiguity''' is the type of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in which a [[phrase]], statement, or resolution is not explicitly defined, making several interpretations [[wikt:plausible#Adjective|plausible]]. A common aspect of ambiguity is [[uncertainty]]. It is thus an [[Attribute grammar|attribute]] of any idea or statement whose [[intention|intended]] meaning cannot be definitively resolved, according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps. (The [[prefix]] ''[[wikt:ambi-#Prefix|ambi]]-''  reflects the idea of &quot;[[2 (number)|two]],&quot; as in &quot;two meanings.&quot;)

The concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with [[vagueness]]. In ambiguity, specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately obvious), whereas with vague information it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity.

The aardvark is found over much of the southern two-thirds of the African continent, avoiding areas that are mainly rocky. A nocturnal feeder, it subsists on ants and termites, which it will dig out of their hills using its sharp claws and powerful legs. It also digs to create burrows in which to live and rear its young. The animal is listed as &quot;least concern&quot; by the [[IUCN]], although its numbers are decreasing.

Adobe architecture has been dated to before 5,100 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Mauricio|first1=Ana Cecilia|last2=Grieseler|first2=Rolf|last3=Heller|first3=Andrew R.|last4=Kelley|first4=Alice R.|last5=Rumiche|first5=Francisco|last6=Sandweiss|first6=Daniel H.|last7=Viveen|first7=Willem|date=2021-11-30|title=The earliest adobe monumental architecture in the Americas|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=118|issue=48|doi=10.1073/pnas.2102941118|issn=0027-8424|pmid=34782482|pmc=8640935 |bibcode=2021PNAS..11802941M |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''adventure''' is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes [[risk]]y.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Adventure |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure |access-date=13 June 2013 |website=dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adventures may be activities with danger such as [[traveling]], [[exploring]], [[skydiving]], [[mountain climbing]], [[scuba diving]], [[river rafting]], or other [[extreme sports]]. Adventures are often undertaken to create psychological [[arousal]] or in order to achieve a greater goal, such as the pursuit of [[knowledge]] that can only be obtained by such activities.

Asia shares the [[landmass]] of [[Eurasia]] with [[Europe]], and of [[Afro-Eurasia]] with both Europe and [[Africa]]. In general terms, it is bounded on the east by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the south by the [[Indian Ocean]], and on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The border of Asia with Europe is a [[social constructionism|historical and cultural construct]], as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them. It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in [[classical antiquity]]. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects [[East–West dichotomy|East–West]] cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. A commonly accepted division places Asia to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] separating it from [[Africa]]; and to the east of the [[Turkish Straits]], the [[Ural Mountains]] and [[Ural (river)|Ural River]], and to the south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] seas, separating it from Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=National Geographic Atlas of the World |edition=7th |year=1999 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] |isbn=978-0-7922-7528-2}} &quot;Europe&quot; (pp. 68–69); &quot;Asia&quot; (pp. 90–91): &quot;A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a [[toponymy|name]] dating back to [[classical antiquity]]—may actually have more to do with [[human geography]] than [[physical geography]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Asia varies greatly across and within [[Regions of Asia|its regions]] with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems. It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the [[Middle East]], temperate areas in the east and the &lt;!-- extremely --&gt; continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in [[Siberia]].

The '''Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union''' was an agreement among the 13 states of the [[United States]], formerly the [[Thirteen Colonies]], that served as the nation's first [[Constitution|frame of government]]. It was debated by the [[Second Continental Congress]] at [[Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia]] between July 1776 and November 1777, and finalized by the Congress on November 15, 1777. It [[Coming into force|came into force]] on March 1, 1781, after being [[ratified]] by all 13 colonial states. A guiding principle of the Articles was the establishment and preservation of the independence and sovereignty of the states. The Articles consciously established a weak [[central government]], affording it only those powers the former colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament. The document provided clearly written rules for how the states' league of friendship, known as the [[Perpetual Union]], would be organized.

While waiting for all states to ratify, the Congress observed the Articles as it conducted business, directing the [[American Revolutionary War|war effort]], conducting diplomacy with foreign states, addressing territorial issues and dealing with Native American relations. Little changed procedurally once the Articles of Confederation went into effect, as ratification did little more than constitutionalize what the [[Continental Congress]] had been doing. That body was renamed the [[Congress of the Confederation]]; but most Americans continued to call it the Continental Congress, since its organization remained the same.

As the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing U.S. states, its delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government (such as in assembling delegates, raising funds, and regulating commerce)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Identifying Defects in the Constitution {{!}} To Form a More Perfect Union {{!}} Articles and Essays {{!}} Documents from the Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention, 1774-1789 {{!}} Digital Collections {{!}} Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/continental-congress-and-constitutional-convention-from-1774-to-1789/articles-and-essays/to-form-a-more-perfect-union/identifying-defects-in-the-constitution/ |access-date=2022-07-05 |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; rendered it ineffective at doing so. As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]], some prominent political thinkers in the fledgling union began asking for changes to the Articles. Their hope was to create a stronger government. Initially, in September 1786, [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|some states met]] to address interstate [[Protectionism|protectionist trade barriers]] between them. Shortly thereafter, as more states became interested in meeting to revise the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787. This became the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]]. Delegates quickly agreed that the defects of the frame of government could not be remedied by altering the Articles, and so went beyond their mandate by replacing it with a new constitution.  On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]. The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the [[President of the United States|president]]), [[List of courts of the United States|courts]], and [[Taxation in the United States|taxing powers]].

It is known to separate the &quot;[[Old World]]&quot; of [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[Asia]] from the &quot;[[New World]]&quot; of the [[Americas]] in the European perception of [[Earth|the World]].

Through its separation of Europe, Africa, and Asia from the Americas, the Atlantic Ocean has played a central role in the development of human society, globalization, and the histories of many nations. While the [[Norse exploration of North America|Norse]] were the first known humans to cross the Atlantic, it was the [[expedition of Christopher Columbus]] in 1492 that proved to be the most consequential. Columbus' expedition ushered in an [[Age of Discovery|age of exploration]] and [[colonization of the Americas by European powers]], most notably [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[French colonial empire|France]], and the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]]. From the 16th to 19th centuries, the Atlantic Ocean was the center of both [[Atlantic slave trade|an eponymous slave trade]] and the [[Columbian exchange]] while occasionally hosting naval battles. Such naval battles, as well as growing trade from regional American powers like the [[United States]] and [[Brazil]], both increased in degree during the early 20th century, and while no major military conflicts took place in the Atlantic in the present day, the ocean remains a core component of trade around the world.

The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between [[Europe]] and [[Africa]] to the east, and the [[Americas]] to the west. As one component of the interconnected [[World Ocean]], it is connected in the north to the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the southwest, the [[Indian Ocean]] in the southeast, and the [[Southern Ocean]] in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to [[Antarctica]]). The Atlantic Ocean is divided in two parts, by the [[Equatorial Counter Current]], with the '''North(ern) Atlantic Ocean''' and the '''South(ern) Atlantic Ocean''' split at about [[8th parallel north|8°N]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USN-2001&quot; /&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2023|According to the International Hydrographic Organization the North an d South Atlantic Oceans are separated by the Equator.}}

'''Albedo''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|d|oʊ}}; {{etymology|la|albedo|whiteness}}) is the fraction of [[sunlight]] that is [[Diffuse reflection|diffusely reflected]] by a body. It is measured on a scale from 0 (corresponding to a [[black body]] that absorbs all incident radiation) to 1 (corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation).

Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of [[Radiosity (radiometry)|radiosity]] ''J''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; to the [[irradiance]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; (flux per unit area) received by a surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/782/Lectures/03_Radiometry.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parent.1/classes/782/Lectures/03_Radiometry.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Fundamentals of Rendering - Radiometry / Photometry|author1=Pharr|author2=Humphreys|website=Web.cse.ohio-state.edu|access-date=2 March 2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://curry.eas.gatech.edu/Courses/6140/ency/Chapter9/Ency_Atmos/Reflectance_Albedo_Surface.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Reflectance and albedo, surface |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Atmosphere |editor=J.

A. |publisher=Academic Press |year=2003|pages=1914–1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location, and time (see [[position of the Sun]]). While bi-hemispherical [[reflectance]] is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the Sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, monthly, or annual averages.

Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henderson-Sellers |first1=A. |last2=Wilson |first2=M. F.|year=1983 |quote=Albedo observations of the Earth's surface for climate research |jstor=37357 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A |volume=309 |issue=1508 |title=The Study of the Ocean and the Land Surface from Satellites |pages=285–294 |bibcode=1983RSPTA.309..285H |doi=10.1098/rsta.1983.0042|s2cid=122094064 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes [[visible spectrum|visible light]] (0.4–0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).

[[Ice–albedo feedback]] is a [[positive feedback]] climate process where a change in the area of [[ice caps]], [[glaciers]], and [[sea ice]] alters the albedo and surface temperature of a planet. [[Ice]] is very reflective, therefore it reflects far more solar energy back to space than the other types of land area or open water. Ice–albedo feedback plays an important role in global [[Climate change (general concept)|climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Budyko |first=M.

Albedo is an important concept in [[climatology]], [[astronomy]], and environmental management. The average albedo of the Earth from the upper atmosphere, its ''planetary albedo'', is 30–35% because of [[cloud cover]], but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental Encyclopedia |url=https://archive.org/details/environmentalenc01cunn |url-access=registration |edition=3rd |publisher=Thomson Gale |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-7876-5486-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angola''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-Angola-pronunciation.ogg|æ|n|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|l|ə}} {{respell|an|GOH|lə}}; {{IPA|pt|ɐ̃ˈɡɔlɐ|lang}}; {{lang-kg|Ngola}}, {{IPA|kg|ŋɔla|pron}}), officially the '''Republic of Angola''' ({{lang-pt|República de Angola}}), is a country on the west-[[Central Africa|central]] coast of [[Southern Africa]]. It is the second-largest [[Lusophone]] ([[List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language|Portuguese-speaking]]) country in both total area and [[List of countries and dependencies by population|population]] (behind [[Brazil]] in both cases), and is the [[List of African countries by area|seventh-largest]] country in [[Africa]]. It is bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north, [[Zambia]] to the east, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. Angola has an [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] province, the province of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]], that borders the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and most populous city is [[Luanda]].

Angola has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic|Paleolithic Age]]. Its formation as a nation-state originates from [[European exploration of Africa|Portuguese colonisation]], which initially began with coastal settlements and [[trading post]]s founded in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers gradually began to establish themselves in the interior. The [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese colony]] that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century, owing to resistance by native groups such as the Cuamato, the [[Oukwanyama|Kwanyama]] and the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]].

After a protracted [[Angolan War of Independence|anti-colonial struggle]], Angola achieved independence in 1975 as a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[People's Republic of Angola|one-party Republic]]. The country descended into a devastating [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] the same year, between the ruling [[MPLA|People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), backed by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]], the insurgent [[UNITA|National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]], an originally [[Maoism|Maoist]] and later anti-communist group supported by the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]], and the militant organization [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], backed by [[Zaire]]. The country has been governed by MPLA ever since its independence in 1975. Following the end of the war in 2002, Angola emerged as a relatively stable [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[constitutional republic]].

Angola has vast [[Mineral resource estimation|mineral]] and [[Oil reserves|petroleum reserves]], and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world, especially since the end of the civil war; however, economic growth is highly uneven, with most of the nation's [[Distribution of wealth#Wealth concentration|wealth concentrated]] in a disproportionately small part of the population; the largest investment and trade partners are [[China]] and the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|date=13 April 2010|title=Transparency and Accountability in Angola|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006051053/http://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|archive-date=6 October 2015|access-date=1 April 2016|website=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[standard of living]] remains low for most Angolans; [[life expectancy]] is among the [[List of countries by life expectancy|lowest in the world]], while [[infant mortality]] is [[List of countries by infant and under-five mortality rates|among the highest]].&lt;ref name=&quot;:2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Life expectancy at birth|year=2014|work=World Fact Book|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|access-date=4 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120024054/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html|archive-date=20 January 2016|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angola is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[OPEC]], [[African Union]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], and the [[Southern African Development Community]]. {{As of|2021}}, the Angolan population is estimated at 32.87 million. Angola is multicultural and multiethnic. [[Angolan culture]] reflects centuries of Portuguese influence, namely the predominance of the [[Portuguese language]] and of the [[Catholic Church]], intermingled with a variety of indigenous customs and traditions.


{{Short description|Organized society in the African state}}
The current '''political regime in [[Angola]]''' is [[presidentialism]], in which the President of the Republic is also head of state and government; it is advised by a Council of Ministers, which together with the President form the national executive power. Legislative power rests with the 220 parliamentarians elected to the National Assembly. The President of the Republic, together with the parliament, appoints the majority of the members of the two highest bodies of the judiciary, that is, the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court. The judiciary is still made up of the Court of Auditors and the Supreme Military Court.

The [[Cabinet of Angola|Angolan government]] is composed of three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial. For decades, political power has been concentrated in the presidency with the [[MPLA|People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]].

[[File:Angola_population.svg|350px|alt=|thumb|Angolas population between 1960 and 2017.]]
According to 2014 census data, Angola had a population of 25,789,024 inhabitants in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aiangola.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Publicação-Resultados-Definitivos-Censo-Geral-2014_Versão-22032016_DEFINITIVA-18H17.pdf |title= Resultados Definitivos do Censo 2014 RESULTADOS DEFINITIVOS RECENSEAMENTO GERAL DA POPULAÇÃO HABITAÇÃO |date=2014 |website=aiangola.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506013702/http://aiangola.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Publica%C3%A7%C3%A3o-Resultados-Definitivos-Censo-Geral-2014_Vers%C3%A3o-22032016_DEFINITIVA-18H17.pdf |archive-date=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethnically, there are three main groups, each speaking a [[Bantu language]]: the [[Southern Mbundu people|Ovimbundu]] who represent 37% of the population, the [[Northern Mbundu people|Ambundu]] with 25%, and the [[Kongo people|Bakongo]] 11%. Other numerically important groups include the closely interrelated [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] and [[Lunda people|Lunda]], the [[Ganguela]] and [[Nyaneka]]-[[Khumbi]] (in both cases classification terms that stand for a variety of small groups), the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]], the [[Herero people|Herero]],  the [[Xindonga]] and scattered residual groups of [[San people|San]]. In addition, mixed race (European and African) people amount to about 30%, with (15%) population of whites, mainly ethnically [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]].

As a [[Angola (Portugal)|former overseas territory of Portugal]] until 1975, Angola possesses a Portuguese population of over 200,000, a number that has been growing from 2000 onwards, because of Angola's growing demand for qualified human resources. Currently, over 300,000 Angolans are white, 1 million Angolans are mixed race (black and white) and 50,000 Angolans are from China, which accounts for 1.35 million people. In 1974, white Angolans made up a population of 350,000 people in an overall population of 6.3 million Angolans at that time. The only reliable source on these numbers is Gerald Bender &amp; Stanley Yoder, ''Whites in Angola on the Eve of Independence: The Politics of Numbers'', ''Africa Today'', 21 (4) 1974, pp.&amp;nbsp;23 – 37. Today, many Angolans who are not ethnic Portuguese can claim Portuguese nationality under Portuguese law. Estimates on the overall population are given in [http://www.opais.net/pt/opais/?det=7192 O País]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/12079340?story_id=12079340|title=Flight from Angola|date=1975-08-16|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2017-07-10|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/angola/34.htm|title=Angola - The Portuguese Coup d'Etat and the End of the Colonial Era|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{in lang|pt}} [https://jn.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/Sociedade/Interior.aspx?content_id=1165354 Portugueses em Angola quadruplicaram] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311001844/http://jn.sapo.pt/PaginaInicial/Sociedade/Interior.aspx?content_id=1165354 |date=March 11, 2009 }}, [[Jornal de Notícias]] (March 10, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the Portuguese, significant numbers of people from other European and from diverse Latin American countries (especially Brazil) can be found. From the 2000s, many Chinese have settled and started up small businesses, while at least as many have come as workers for large enterprises (construction or other). Observers claim that the Chinese community in Angola might include as many as 300,000 persons at the end of 2010, but reliable statistics are not at this stage available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/9052011.stm|title=BBC News - Chinese karaoke fans sing Angola's praises|website=news.bbc.co.uk|date=October 2, 2010 |language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974/75, over 25,000 [[Cuba]]n soldiers arrived in Angola to help the MPLA forces at the beginning of the [[Angolan Civil War]]. Once this was over, a massive development cooperation in the field of health and education brought in numerous civil personnel from Cuba. However, only a very small percentage of all these people has remained in Angola, either for personal reasons (intermarriage) or as professionals (e.g., medical doctors).

The largest religious denomination is [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], to which adheres about half the population. Roughly 26% are followers of traditional forms of [[Protestantism]] (Congregationals, Methodists, Baptista, Lutherans, Reformed), but over the last decades there has in addition been a growth of Pentecostal communities and [[African Initiated Church]]es. In 2006, one out of 221 people were [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. Blacks from Mali, Nigeria and Senegal are mostly Sunnite Muslims, but do not make up more than 1 - 2% of the population. By now few Angolans retain [[African traditional religion]]s following different ethnic faiths.

[[File:GDP per capita development of Angola.svg|thumb|Change in per capita GDP of Angola, 1950–2018. Figures are inflation-adjusted to 2011 International dollars.]]
The '''economy of [[Angola]]''' remains heavily influenced by the effects of four decades of conflict in the last part of the 20th century, the [[Angolan War of Independence|war for independence from Portugal (1961–75)]] and the subsequent [[Angolan Civil War|civil war (1975–2002)]]. Despite extensive [[Crude oil|oil and gas]] resources, diamonds, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] potential, and rich agricultural land, Angola remains poor, and a third of the population relies on [[subsistence agriculture]]. Since 2002, when the 27-year civil war ended, government policy prioritized the repair and improvement of infrastructure and strengthening of political and social institutions. During the first decade of the 21st century, Angola's economy was one of the fastest-growing in the world,&lt;ref name=&quot;fastest&quot;&gt;Birgitte Refslund Sørensen and Marc Vincent.

'''Albert Sidney Johnston''' (February 2, 1803 – April 6, 1862) served as a [[General officer|general]] in three different armies: the [[Texian Army]], the [[United States Army]], and the [[Confederate States Army]]. He saw extensive combat during his 34-year military career, fighting actions in the [[Black Hawk War]], the [[Texas-Indian Wars]], the [[Mexican–American War]], the [[Utah War]], and the [[American Civil War]].

Considered by Confederate States President [[Jefferson Davis]] to be the finest general officer in the Confederacy before the later emergence of [[Robert E. Lee]], he was killed early in the Civil War at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] on April 6, 1862. Johnston was the highest-ranking officer on either side killed during the entire war. Davis believed the loss of General Johnston &quot;was the turning point of our fate.&quot;

Johnston was unrelated to Confederate general [[Joseph E. Johnston]].

'''Alberta''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|b|ɜːr|t|ə}} {{respell|al|BUR|tə}}) is one of the thirteen [[provinces and territories of Canada|provinces and territories]] of Canada. It is part of [[Western Canada]] and is one of the three [[Canadian Prairies|prairie provinces]]. Alberta is bordered by [[British Columbia]] to the west, [[Saskatchewan]] to the east, the [[Northwest Territories]] (NWT) to the north, and the [[U.S. state]] of [[Montana]] to the south. It is one of the only two landlocked provinces in Canada (Saskatchewan being the other).&lt;ref name=&quot;:3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=April 1, 2011|title=Get to know Canada - Provinces and territories|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada/provinces-territories.html|access-date=October 16, 2020|website=aem|archive-date=October 18, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018025653/https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/prepare-life-canada/provinces-territories.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern part of the province is occupied by the [[Great Plains]], while the western part borders the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The province has a predominantly [[humid continental climate|continental climate]] but experiences quick temperature changes due to air [[arid]]ity. Seasonal temperature swings are less pronounced in western Alberta due to occasional [[Chinook wind]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wenckstern |first=Erin |date=January 8, 2015 |title=Chinook winds and Alberta weather |url=http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/chinook-winds-and-alberta-weather/43265 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004121500/http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/chinook-winds-and-alberta-weather/43265/ |archive-date=October 4, 2015 |access-date=October 3, 2015 |publisher=The Weather Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1930s, [[Politics of Alberta|Alberta's political landscape]] consisted of 2 major parties: the centre-left [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]] and the [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[United Farmers of Alberta]]. Today, Alberta is generally perceived as a conservative province. The right-wing [[Alberta Social Credit Party|Social Credit Party]] held office continually from 1935 to 1971 before the centre-right [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservatives]] held office continually from 1971 to 2015, the latter being the longest unbroken run in government at the provincial or federal level in Canadian history.

Before becoming part of Canada, Alberta was home to several [[First Nations in Alberta|First Nations]] like [[Plains Indians]] and [[Woodland Cree]]. It was also a territory used by [[fur trade]]rs of the rival companies [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and [[North West Company]]. The Dominion of Canada bought the lands that would become Alberta as part of the NWT in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History &amp; Geology|url=https://www.bowvalleynaturalists.org/natural-history/banff-snail/history-geology/|access-date=October 16, 2020|website=Bow Valley Naturalists|language=en-CA|archive-date=February 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210214081724/https://www.bowvalleynaturalists.org/natural-history/banff-snail/history-geology/|url-status=dead}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 1800s to early 1900s, many immigrants arrived to prevent the prairies from being annexed by the US. Growing wheat and cattle ranching also became very profitable. In 1905, the [[Alberta Act]] was passed, creating the province of Alberta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alberta becomes a Province&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Alberta becomes a Province|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/events/becoming_province.html|access-date=August 6, 2009|publisher=Alberta Online Encyclopedia|archive-date=April 22, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422163353/http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/events/becoming_province.html|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massive oil reserves were discovered in 1947. The exploitation of [[oil sands]] began in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;alberta1947&quot;/&gt;

Alberta is renowned for its natural beauty, richness in fossils and for housing important nature reserves. Alberta is home to six [[UNESCO]] designated [[World Heritage Site]]s: the [[Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks World Heritage Site|Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks]], [[Dinosaur Provincial Park]], [[Head-Smashed-In Buffalo Jump]], [[Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park]], [[Wood Buffalo National Park]] and [[Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Heritage Sites in Alberta|url=https://www.albertaparks.ca/albertaparksca/management-land-use/national-international-programs/world-heritage-sites-in-alberta/|access-date=October 16, 2020|website=www.albertaparks.ca|archive-date=September 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200930230556/https://www.albertaparks.ca/albertaparksca/management-land-use/national-international-programs/world-heritage-sites-in-alberta/|url-status=live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular sites include [[Banff National Park]], [[Elk Island National Park]], [[Jasper National Park]], [[Waterton Lakes National Park]], and [[Drumheller]].

'''Actinopterygii''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|k|t|ᵻ|n|ɒ|p|t|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|dʒ|i|aɪ}}; {{etymology||{{wikt-lang|mul|actino-}}|having rays|grc|''{{wikt-lang|grc|πτέρυξ}}'' (ptérux)|wing, fins}}), members of which are known as '''ray-finned fish''' or '''actinopterygians''', is a [[class (biology)|class]] of [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vertebrates: Comparative Anatomy, Function, Evolution |last=Kardong |first=Kenneth |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education]] |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-07-802302-6 |location=New York |pages=99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; that comprise over 50% of living [[vertebrate]] species.&lt;ref name=&quot;NelsonFoW&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Nelson |first=Joseph S. |author-link=Joseph S. Nelson |title=Fishes of the World |year=2016 |publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |isbn=978-1-118-34233-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are so called because of their lightly built [[fish fin|fin]]s made of webs of [[skin]] supported by radially extended bony spines, as opposed to the bulkier, fleshy lobed fins of the sister class [[Sarcopterygii]] (lobe-finned fish). Resembling [[folding fan]]s, the actinopterygian fins can change shape easily and provide superior [[thrust-to-weight ratio]]s per movement compared to sarcopterygian and [[chondrichthyian]] fins. The fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements, the radials, which represent the [[articulation (anatomy)|articulation]] between these fins and the internal skeleton (e.g., pelvic and pectoral girdles).

The vast majority (~99%) of actinopterygians are [[teleost]]s. By [[species]] count, they dominate the [[subphylum]] [[Vertebrata]], and constitute nearly 99% of the over 30,000 [[extant taxon|extant]] species of [[fish]].&lt;ref&gt;(Davis, Brian 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; They are the most abundant [[nektonic]] [[aquatic animal]]s and are ubiquitous throughout [[freshwater]] and [[ocean|marine]] environments from the [[deep sea]] to [[subterranean river|subterranean water]]s to the highest [[mountain stream]]s. Extant species can range in size from ''[[Paedocypris]]'', at {{cvt|8|mm|in|1}}; to the massive [[ocean sunfish]], at {{cvt|2300|kg|lb|-1}}; and to the long-bodied [[oarfish]], at {{cvt|11|m|ft|0}}.

Best known for developing the [[theory of relativity]], he also made important contributions to [[quantum mechanics]], and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that [[modern physics]] accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;frs&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;YangHamilton2010&quot; /&gt; His [[mass–energy equivalence]] formula {{math|1=[[Mass–energy equivalence#Mass–velocity relationship|''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]}}, which arises from relativity theory, has been called &quot;the world's most famous equation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LnLVo&quot; /&gt; He received the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] &quot;for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the [[photoelectric effect]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel Prize&quot; /&gt; a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the [[philosophy of science]].&lt;ref name=&quot;xZQWt&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3UiiT&quot; /&gt; In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal [[Physics World]], Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=Physics: past, present, future |url=https://physicsworld.com/a/physics-past-present-future/ |work=Physics World | date=1999-12-06|access-date=2023-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; His intellectual achievements and originality have made the word ''Einstein'' broadly synonymous with genius.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordnetweb.princeton.edu&quot; /&gt;

In 1905, a year sometimes described as his ''[[annus mirabilis]]'' (miracle year), Einstein published [[Annus mirabilis papers|four groundbreaking papers]].{{sfnp|Galison|2000|p=377}} These outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained [[Brownian motion]], introduced his [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]]—a theory which addressed the inability of [[classical mechanics]] to account satisfactorily for the behavior of the [[electromagnetic field]]—and demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]] that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate [[gravitation]]. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the [[universe]] as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nobel&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-20151124&quot; /&gt; The middle part of his career also saw him making important contributions to [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of [[radiation]], in which light consists of particles, subsequently called [[photon]]s.

For much of the last phase of his academic life, Einstein worked on two endeavors that proved ultimately unsuccessful. Firstly, he fought a long rearguard action against quantum theory's introduction of fundamental randomness into science's picture of the world, objecting that &quot;God does not play dice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05004-4 |title=Did Einstein really say that? |last=Robinson |first=Andrew |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=30 April 2018 |volume=557 |number=30 |page=30 |doi=10.1038/d41586-018-05004-4 |bibcode=2018Natur.557...30R |s2cid=14013938 |access-date=21 February 2021 |archive-date=9 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109033021/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05004-4 |url-status=live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, he attempted to devise a [[unified field theory]] by generalizing his geometric theory of gravitation to include [[electromagnetism]] too. As a result, he became increasingly isolated from the mainstream of modern physics.

Born in the [[German Empire]], Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895, forsaking his German citizenship (as a subject of the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]])&lt;ref group=note name=GEcitizen/&gt; the following year. In 1897, at the age of seventeen, he enrolled in the mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Swiss [[ETH Zurich|Federal polytechnic school]] in [[Zürich]], graduating in 1900.

The country is located in the [[Balkans]] on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea]]s within the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and shares [[land border]]s with [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Kosovo]] to the northeast, [[North Macedonia]] to the east and [[Greece]] to the south. Spanning an area of {{convert|28748|sqkm|abbr=on}}, it displays a varied range of climatic, geological, hydrological and morphological conditions. The country's landscapes range from rugged snow-capped mountains in the [[Accursed Mountains|Albanian Alps]] and the [[Korab]], [[Central Mountain Range, Albania#Skanderbeg Mountains|Skanderbeg]], [[Pindus]] and [[Ceraunian Mountains]], to fertile lowland plains extending from the coasts of the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast|Adriatic]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast|Ionian]] seas. [[Tirana]] is the capital and largest city in the country, followed by [[Durrës]], [[Vlorë]], and [[Shkodër]].

In ancient times, the [[Illyrians]] inhabited northern and central regions of Albania, whilst [[Epirotes]] inhabited the south. Several important ancient [[Greek colonisation|Greek colonies]] were also established on the coast. In the 2nd century BCE, the region was annexed by the [[Roman Republic]], and after the division of the [[Roman Empire]] it became part of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. The first known [[Albanians|Albanian]] autonomous principality – [[Arbanon]] – was established in the 12th century. The [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]], [[Principality of Albania (medieval)|Principality of Albania]] and [[Albania Veneta]] were formed between the 13th and 15th centuries in different parts of the country, alongside other Albanian principalities and political entities. In the late 15th century, Albania [[Ottoman Albania|became part]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until 1912, when the modern Albanian state [[Declaration of independence of Albania|declared independence]]. In 1939, the [[Kingdom of Albania (1928–39)|Kingdom of Albania]] was invaded by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], which became [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)|Greater Albania]], and then a [[Albanian Kingdom (1943–44)|protectorate]] of [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=zolo2002&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7KNgpZRnM8C&amp;q=Albania+nazi+protectorate&amp;pg=PA181 |title=Invoking Humanity: War, Law and Global Order |last=Zolo|first=D. |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |page=180 |date=27 August 2002|isbn=9780826456564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war, the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]] was formed, which lasted until the [[Revolutions of 1989|Revolutions of 1991]] concluded with the [[fall of communism in Albania]] and eventually the establishment of the current Republic of Albania.

Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime.  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amateur astronomy''' is a [[hobby]] where participants enjoy observing or imaging [[celestial objects]] in the [[sky]] using the [[Naked eye|unaided eye]], [[binoculars]], or [[telescope]]s. Even though scientific [[research]] may not be their primary goal, some amateur astronomers make contributions in doing [[citizen science]], such as by monitoring [[variable stars]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AAVSO&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Amateur astronomers do not use the field of [[astronomy]] as their primary source of [[income]] or support, and usually have no [[professional degree]] in astrophysics or advanced academic training in the subject.  Most amateurs are hobbyists, while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and may often assist and work alongside professional astronomers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skytelescope&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Amateur astronomers typically view the sky at night, when most celestial objects and astronomical events are visible, but others observe during the daytime by viewing the [[Sun]] and [[solar eclipse]]s.  Some just look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes or binoculars, but more dedicated amateurs often use portable [[optical telescope|telescopes]] or telescopes situated in their private or club [[observatory|observatories]]. Amateurs can also join as members of amateur [[astronomical society|astronomical societies]], which can advise, educate or guide them towards ways of finding and observing celestial objects. They can also promote the science of astronomy among the general public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Motta2006&quot;&gt;

Aikido is now practiced in around 140 countries. It was originally developed by [[Morihei Ueshiba]], as a synthesis of his martial studies, philosophy and religious beliefs. Ueshiba's goal was to create an art that practitioners could use to defend themselves while also protecting their attackers from injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharif |first=Suliaman |title=50 Martial Arts Myths |publisher=New Media Entertainment |year=2009 |page=135 |isbn=978-0-9677546-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ueshiba |first=Kisshōmaru |title=The Art of Aikido: Principles and Essential Techniques |publisher=Kodansha International |year=2004 |page=70 |isbn=4-7700-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aikido is often translated as &quot;the way of unifying (with) [[Qi|life energy]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Aikido derives mainly from the martial art of [[Daitō-ryū Aiki-jūjutsu]], but began to diverge from it in the late 1920s, partly due to Ueshiba's involvement with the [[Ōmoto-kyō]] religion. Ueshiba's early students' documents bear the term {{transl|ja|aiki-jūjutsu}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pranin-Aikijujutsu&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Ueshiba's senior students have different approaches to aikido, depending partly on when they studied with him. Today, aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.
