[[File:Scottish Stirrup Cups.jpg|thumb|Scottish silver stirrup cups, Hallmarked Edinburgh, 1917]]

The &quot;parting glass&quot;, or &quot;[[stirrup cup]]&quot;, was the final hospitality offered to a departing guest. Once they had mounted, they were presented one final drink to fortify them for their travels. The custom was practised in several continental countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Miscellaneous compositions in verse / illustrated by occasional prefatory specific , and copious explanatory notes|author=Levett Hanson |location=Copenhagen |publisher=J.

===Text===
The earliest known printed version was as a [[Broadside (music)|broadside]] in the 1770s and it first appeared in book form in ''Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs, Heroic Ballads, etc.'' by [[David Herd (anthologist)|Herd]].&lt;ref name=&quot;contemplator&quot;/&gt; An early version is sometimes attributed to [[Sir Alexander Boswell, 1st Baronet|Sir Alex Boswell]]. The text is doubtless older than its 1770 appearance in broadside, as it was recorded in the [[Skene Manuscript]], a collection of Scottish airs written at various dates between 1615 and 1635.&lt;ref&gt;George Grove and John Alexander Fuller-Maitland. (1908.) ''Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', The Macmillan Company, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; It was known at least as early as 1605, when a portion of the first stanza was written in a farewell letter, as a poem now known as &quot;Armstrong's Goodnight&quot;, by one of the [[Border Reivers]] executed that year for the murder in 1600 of [[Sir John Carmichael]], Warden of the Scottish West March.&lt;ref&gt;George MacDonald Fraser. (1995.) ''Steel Bonnets: The Story of the Anglo-Scottish Border Reivers'', Harper Collins, London, pp. 140–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exact lyrics vary between arrangements, but they include most, if not all, of the following stanzas appearing in different orders:{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lyrics.com/lyric/25183846|title=The Parting Glass Lyrics|website=www.lyrics.com|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mudcat lyrics&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital Tradition - Parting Glass Lyrics and Chords |url=https://mudcat.org/@displaysong.cfm?SongID=4599 |website=The Mudcat Cafe |access-date=2 March 2020 |ref=Mudcat lyrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{poemquote|Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And all the harm I've ever done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To mem'ry now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be to you all

So fill to me the parting glass
And drink a health whate’er befall,
And gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be to you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I gently rise and softly call
Good night and joy be to you all

If I had money enough to spend
And leisure time to sit awhile
There is a fair maid in this town
That sorely has my heart beguiled.
Her rosy cheeks and ruby lips
I own she has my heart in thrall
Then fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all.

A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all
}}

(The final verse is the first verse in the Scots version.)

===Tune===
The earliest known appearance of the tune today associated with this text is as a fiddle tune called &quot;The Peacock&quot;, included in James Aird's ''A Selection of Scots, English, Irish and Foreign Airs'' in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Aird|title=A Selection of Scots, English, Irish and Foreign Airs |year=1782 |volume=2 |page=6 |oclc=43221159 |url=https://archive.org/stream/selectionofsco200ingl#page/n13/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kloss&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justanothertune.com/html/partingglass.html|title=Some Notes On The History Of &quot;The Parting Glass&quot; |last=Kloss |first=Jürgen |date=March 3, 2012 |website=Just Another Tune: Songs and Their History |access-date=March 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/a/aa/IMSLP98438-PMLP202254-aird_selection_of_scotch_air_2.pdf Aird 1782 at IMSLP], p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Burns referred to the air in 1786 as &quot;Good night, and joy be wi' ye a'.&quot; when using it to accompany his [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lyric &quot;The Farewell. To the brethren of St. James's Lodge, Tarbolton&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poems, chiefly in the Scottish dialect|author=Robert Burns|location=Kilmarnock|publisher=J.

In 1800–1802, the song was incorrectly attributed to Joseph Haydn by [[Sigismund von Neukomm]] (1778-1858), who entered it in the [[Hoboken catalogue]] as &quot;Good night and joy be wi' ye. Hob XXXIa 254. Mi mineur&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=[Good night and joy be wi' ye. Hob XXXIa 254. Mi mineur] anglais |work=Catalogue Général|publisher=bnf.fr|url=http://catalogue.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/cb16239615t}}&lt;/ref&gt; which text has been wrongly attributed to Sir Alexander Boswell (1775-1822).

[[Patrick Weston Joyce]], in his ''Old Irish Folk Music and Songs'' (1909), gives the tune with a different text under the name &quot;Sweet Cootehill Town,&quot; noting, &quot;The air seems to have been used indeed as a general farewell tune, so that—from the words of another song of the same class—it is often called 'Good night and joy be with you all.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/oldirishfolkmusi00royauoft|title=Old Irish folk music and songs : a collection of 842 Irish airs and songs, hitherto unpublished|date=2 May 1909|publisher=London : Longmans, Green|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrated Irish folk song collector [[Colm Ó Lochlainn]] has taken note of this identity of melodies between &quot;The Parting Glass&quot; and &quot;Sweet Cootehill Town&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;O Lochlainn, Colm. ''Irish Street Ballads'', Pan, 1978, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Sweet Cootehill Town&quot; is another traditional farewell song, this time involving a man leaving Ireland to go to America.

The tune appeared, with sacred lyrics, in 19th century American tunebooks. &quot;Shouting Hymn&quot; in [[Jeremiah Ingalls]]'s ''Christian Harmony'' (1805) is a related tune.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.singingalls.org/shoutinghymn.htm|title=Shouting Hymn|date=28 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328105032/http://www.singingalls.org/shoutinghymn.htm|archive-date=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tune achieved wider currency among [[shape note]] singers with its publication, associated with a text first known in the 1814 ''Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs'', &quot;Come Now Ye Lovely Social Band&quot;, in [[William Walker (composer)|William Walker]]'s ''[[Southern Harmony]]'' (1835), and in ''[[The Sacred Harp]]'' (1844).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mcsr.olemiss.edu/~mudws/texts/PartingGlass.txt|title=Prof. Warren Steel's page}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sacredharpbremen.org/lieder/026-bis-099/042-clamanda|title=&quot;Clamanda&quot; in ''The Sacred Harp'' (1991 revision).}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the song is still widely sung by Sacred Harp singers under the title &quot;Clamanda&quot;.

===Irish and North American influence===
Dr [[Lori Watson]], a lecturer in Scottish Ethnology at the [[University of Edinburgh]] states that it’s difficult to fully trace the origins of many traditional songs: Although it currently seems that Scotland has evidence of the earliest published melody and several beautiful song variants, the popular Parting Glass currently in circulation has strong Irish and North American influences to thank.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sundaypost.com/fp/the-parting-glass-singer-karine-polwart-on-an-enduring-anthem-of-loss-and-hope-after-recording-new-version-for-margaret-atwood/|title=The Parting Glass: Singer Karine Polwart on an enduring anthem of loss and hope after recording new version for Margaret Atwood|first=Ross|last=Crae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to a modern version by Irish musician [[Hozier (musician)|Hozier]], Scottish singer-songwriter [[Karine Polwart]] notes:&quot;It really knocked my socks off. He clearly comes from a place where he understands his roots, singing in that really old ornamented Irish style. This would be one mark against the Scots claiming it, the tune of it is very like a lot of Irish traditional tunes and the way they sing it is with much more flourish and ornamentation, becoming a fluttering kind of melody. I find that really moving – my favourite versions are almost all by Irish singers.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto4&quot;/&gt;

===Modern adaptations===
&quot;The Parting Glass&quot; was re-introduced to mid-20th century audiences by the recordings and performances of [[The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/the-parting-glass-1542681 |title=The Parting Glass |last=Biege |first=Bernd |date=March 3, 2019 |website=Tripsavvy.com|access-date=March 20, 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their rendition featured a solo vocal by youngest brother [[Liam Clancy|Liam]] and first appeared on their 1959 Tradition Records LP ''[[Come Fill Your Glass with Us]]'' as well as on a number of subsequent recordings, including the group's high-charting live performance album, ''[[In Person at Carnegie Hall]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Top LP's|magazine=Billboard|date=Dec 21, 1963|volume=75|issue=51|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rendition by the Clancys and Makem has been described as &quot;by all accounts... the most influential&quot; of the many recorded versions.&lt;ref name=Kloss /&gt;

The song &quot;[[Restless Farewell]]&quot;, written by [[Bob Dylan]] and featured on ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' from 1964, uses the melody of the nineteenth century versions of &quot;The Parting Glass&quot; with Dylan's original lyrics. Dylan had learned the tune from the singing of the Clancys and Makem.&lt;ref name=Kloss /&gt;

In 1998, the traditional words were set to a new, different melody (reminiscent of [[Mo Ghile Mear]], another Irish traditional song) by Irish composer [[Shaun Davey]]. In 2002, he orchestrated this version for orchestra, choir, pipes, fiddle, and percussion to commemorate the opening of [[The Helix (Dublin)|the Helix Concert Hall]], Dublin, Ireland. His version appears in the film ''[[Waking Ned Devine]]''.{{cn|date=July 2023}}

At the request of [[Margaret Atwood]], to end her guest-edited edition of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s [[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today programme]] with the song, a version by singer [[Karine Polwart]] and pianist Dave Milligan was commissioned.&lt;ref name=&quot;auto2&quot;/&gt;
