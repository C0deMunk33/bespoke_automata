The result of the debate was '''speedy delete'''. [[User:Mushroom|Mushroom]] 15:31, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

I don't think this is a speedy candidate, but it is either a hoax, a vanity page, patent nonsense or a combination of all three. '''Delete''' [[User:Atrian|Atrian]] 04:28, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

*'''Delete''' for being [[WP:Complete Bollocks]]. [[User:Eddie.willers|Eddie.willers]] 05:11, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' per nom - [[User:Nortonew|Nortonew]] 05:15, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
*It is a '''speedy delete''' He &quot;became a vigilante known as Wolfman&quot; who fought &quot;a Neo-Nazi German bear from the future&quot;  -- [[User:Astrokey44|Astrokey44]]&lt;small&gt;|[[User talk:Astrokey44|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 05:20, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
*It even fails [[WP:BALLS]] and [[WP:BJAODN]]. It is [[WP:Stupid]] and qualifies only for '''Speedy delete'''. --[[User:Ezeu|Ezeu]] 06:04, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
* '''Delete''' as [[WP:HOAX|hoax]] and [[WP:BIO|non-notable vanity biography]].  &lt;span class=&quot;user-sig user-Quarl&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;mdash;[[User:Quarl|Quarl]] &lt;sup&gt;([[User Talk:Quarl|talk]])&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;[[2006-01-23]]&amp;nbsp;07:47[[ISO 8601|Z]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
* '''Speedy delete''' as non-notable bio, verging on patent nonsense. [[User:Robin Johnson|Robin Johnson]] 11:29, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
* '''Speedy delete''' per above --[[User:BadSeed|BadSeed]] 11:57, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

* '''Delete''' would go to [[WP:BJAODN]] but unfortunately it's far from funny. [[User:Mushin|Mushin]][[User talk:Mushin|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 14:40, 23 January 2006 (UTC)
